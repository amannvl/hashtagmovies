Here a beautiful scenic and photographic effect is introduced as the vision of the sweetheart of one of the lieutenants fades into view. This gives an opportunity to introduce that famous episode of the letter in which Lord Nelson called back the mail ship for a single message and which is endeared to the hearts of all those who sail the sea. We are then carried along to the morning of October twenty-first, Eighteen Hundred and Five, when the fleet of the enemy is sighted. The decks are cleared for action and the hoisting of the colors is portrayed with all the solemnity of the occasion before entering the battle. The correct incident of the hoisting of the famous signal ""England expects every man to do his duty"" is splendidly portrayed and carried out in every detail, and we note the pathetic touch in Nelson's life in bidding farewell to his captains having at the time a presentiment of his own death. We now get to the little human touch in his life and learn the true character of the man, for, in his last entry in his diary before the battle, he makes peace with his maker. And now we come to that wonderful spectacular picture of the real battle of Trafalgar. We see the ships in action, the firing of the guns, the ships caught on fire and then the camera switches to a close view of the deck of the Victory where human life is sacrificed by the hundreds, the fighting top of the Redoubtable, the fatal shot and Nelson's fall. We then see that wonderful character in his death, the solemnity, the beauty and the pathos of it all being carried out by the Edison players in all its grandeur; his farewell to Captain Hardy, the last kiss, the news of the victory and finally his death.","['We show Lord Nelson leaving the admiralty room where he makes his famous speech and then introduce him with his captains giving the details of that wonderful plan of attack which was carried out to the letter at Trafalgar, the inspirations of the captains and their enthusiastic toast.

The tender farewell with Mercedes arouses the jealous hatred of Fernand, a Catalan fisherman, secretly in love with Mercedes. Dantes gives Mercedes a brooch (which later again figures in the story) and sails away. In mid-sea the captain of the Pharaoh suddenly dies and entrusts Dantes with a private letter from General Murat to the exiled emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, at Elba. Danglars, the supercargo, overhears the captain's dying request, and keeps the knowledge in the event of future need. When the vessel reaches Elba, Dantes delivers the letter to the deposed emperor, and promises to deliver Napoleon's reply to Noirtier, of the Bonaparte Committee. In Dantes' absence Fernand urges his hopeless suit of Mercedes. On the return of the Pharaoh, Morell, its owner, makes Dantes captain of the vessel, a post which Danglars had hoped to secure. After an attempt to murder Dantes, which is frustrated by Mercedes, Fernand and Danglars discover their common enmity of Dantes and plot his ruin. Fernand and Danglars write an anonymous letter to Villefort, King's Attorney, accusing Dantes of delivering contraband communications between Napoleon and his lieutenants, insinuating that such a dispatch may he found in the office of the Pharaoh. Villefort examines Dantes and releases him pending the discovery of the letter. The marriage of Dantes and Mercedes is performed simultaneously with the discovery of the guilty communication. To save his half-brother Noirtier, of the Bonaparte Committee, to whom the letter from the exiled emperor is addressed, Villefort causes Dantes to be apprehended at his wedding feast and imprisoned in the Chateau d'If. Deprived of his son's support, Dantes' father dies of starvation. Mercedes, believing Dantes dead, and for the sake of her fatherless child, Albert, promises to marry Fernand on his return from the war. Meanwhile, with a lone but supreme hope, with marvelous patience and persistence, Dantes works to cut a tunnel through the stone wall to liberty. While Dantes struggles on in his cell, with his single but omniscient hope of freedom as the only spark of cheer in the surrounding despair, with a bitter suggestion of irony, the picture flashes a glimpse of Mercedes, her son, Albert, and Fernand, now a colonel. The Abbe Fraria, another prisoner in the Chateau who in spite of the frailty of age, had for years been cutting a path to possible liberty, struggles on unremittingly, while Dantes from the opposite side continues his similar labor. After years of weary toil they meet in the tunnel, finding instead of liberty only each other and hopelessness. In France Danglars is now a wealthy banker, and the creditor of his former employer, Morell.

Dantes comes to the surface and attains the refuge of a huge rock, from the summit of which he drinks in his liberty, and exclaims from an unleashed soul, ""The World is Mine."" He is rescued by the smuggler ship La Amelia, and turns his eyes and hopes toward Monte Cristo, the grave of the buried treasure. At the isle of Monte Cristo, Dantes escapes from the smuggler ship and finds the hidden treasures of the Spadas. Fabulously wealthy, with all the world before him, he determines to find his friends and detect his enemies, to punish the evil and reward the good. Disguised as the Abbe Busoni he returns to France and learns of his father's death and the plot of Fernand and Danglars. He arranges a meeting with Noirtier at the inn, who comes disguised as a peddler. Villefort, obtaining a suggestion of the Abbe's identity, follows Noirtier, and after a futile attempt to murder his half-brother, driven to despair at the threatened exposure of his villainy, commits suicide. It is then that Dantes, in the knowledge of his power and the thrill of retribution, exclaims ""One,"" signifying that one of his enemies had met the fate his criminality deserved.

Basil believes it threatens disaster. Benedict, however advises patience. ""Now has the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer."" We see Benedict by the wide-mouthed fire place and Evangeline at her spinning wheel. A knock at the door and Basil and Gabriel enter, followed soon by the Notary, who draws the betrothal contract. We next see harvests gathered in. the peasants working on the dikes, and then the betrothal feast spread ""under the open sky. In the odorous air of the orchard."" After the feast they dance under the orchard trees. PART III: ""And lo, with a summons sonorous,"" while they were merrily dancing, ""Sounded the bell from its tower"" bidding them to come to the church to bear the King's Mandate. ""Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the church-yard, waited the women."" The English soldiers marched on, and demanding admittance in the King's name, ""enter the sacred portal."" Colonel Winslow, in front of the chancel, reads the King's Mandate, that inside of five days they must be driven from their homes and their lands be confiscated by the State. Their wives may gather such of their household goods as they can carry with them. The men will be kept prisoners in the church until the day of embarking. After hearing the mandate all is uproar and confusion. High above the others rises Basil's voice crying, ""Down with the tyrants."" In the midst of the confusion Father Felician enters the door of the chancel and with a gesture, quiets them. Pointing to the figure of the crucified Christ he leads them to repeat His prayer, ""O Father, forgive them."" Meanwhile, Evangeline listens at the door and window, but in vain. Then, all forgetful of self, she wanders into the village, ""cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women."" PART IV: On the fifth day the women and children are seen carrying their household goods to the seashore, urging on the oxen and looking back sadly at their homes that they may never see again. Late in the afternoon the church doors are opened and the soldiers lead forth the patient Arcadian men. When they reach the shore they find their goods piled in confusion and disorder. ""So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried, while in despair on the shore, Evangeline stood with her father."" They lighted fires on the shore and the priest wandered from fire to fire, cheering and consoling, until he approached Evangeline and Benedict. Vainly Evangeline tried to cheer her father. Suddenly there is seen a light, which grows broader and higher and redder. The crowd cry aloud in their anguish, ""We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!"" Overwhelmed with the sight the priest and maiden gaze in horror. As they turn to speak to Benedict they find he has fallen, and lies motionless on the ground, his soul departed. Evangeline kneels at her father's side and wails aloud in her sorrow, ""Let us bury him here."" and the priest said, ""Lo, with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation solemnly answered the sea."" PART V: ""Many a weary year has passed since the burning of Grand-Pre."" Evangeline commences her endless search for Gabriel, cheered by the faithful Father Felician. Hearing that he is with Basil in the South, they start southward with a few Arcadian boatmen. Evangeline, cheered by a vision of Gabriel beckoning her onward, falls peacefully asleep. ""While all are slumbering, through the darkness a light, swift boat draws near and passes on the other shore."" it was Gabriel, who goes to the western wilds seeking, ""oblivion of self and of sorrow."" When they reach Basil's home they find him a prosperous herdsman. Basil goes with Evangeline to pursue Gabriel, leaving Father Felician to rest. Gabriel is always ahead; sometimes they find the ashes of his camp-fire. A Shawnee Indian woman leads them to the Mission of the Black Robe Chief, who tells them Gabriel was there six days before and will return again in the spring. Evangeline remains to wait, while Basil goes back to his home. Gabriel does not return, and at length, discouraged, Evangeline gives up the search, and becomes a Sister of Mercy. ""Fair was she, and young, when in hope began the long journey. Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended."" After many years a pestilence falls on the city, and Evangeline, in a hospital ward of an alms house, finds Gabriel, who dies in her arms. ""All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow."" Meekly she bowed her head and murmured, ""Father, I thank thee!"" In an old graveyard are seen two nameless graves, in which the lovers are sleeping, side by side. ""Still stands the forest primeval. Maidens still wear their Norman caps and kirtles of homespun, and by the evening's fire repeat Evangeline's story. While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.""","['PART I: Evangeline and Gabriel as children are being taught their lessons by Father Felician, priest and pedagogue.

We next see harvests gathered in. the peasants working on the dikes, and then the betrothal feast spread ""under the open sky. In the odorous air of the orchard."" After the feast they dance under the orchard trees. PART III: ""And lo, with a summons sonorous,"" while they were merrily dancing, ""Sounded the bell from its tower"" bidding them to come to the church to bear the King\'s Mandate. ""Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the church-yard, waited the women."" The English soldiers marched on, and demanding admittance in the King\'s name, ""enter the sacred portal."" Colonel Winslow, in front of the chancel, reads the King\'s Mandate, that inside of five days they must be driven from their homes and their lands be confiscated by the State. Their wives may gather such of their household goods as they can carry with them. The men will be kept prisoners in the church until the day of embarking. After hearing the mandate all is uproar and confusion. High above the others rises Basil\'s voice crying, ""Down with the tyrants."" In the midst of the confusion Father Felician enters the door of the chancel and with a gesture, quiets them. Pointing to the figure of the crucified Christ he leads them to repeat His prayer, ""O Father, forgive them."" Meanwhile, Evangeline listens at the door and window, but in vain. Then, all forgetful of self, she wanders into the village, ""cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women."" PART IV: On the fifth day the women and children are seen carrying their household goods to the seashore, urging on the oxen and looking back sadly at their homes that they may never see again. Late in the afternoon the church doors are opened and the soldiers lead forth the patient Arcadian men. When they reach the shore they find their goods piled in confusion and disorder. ""So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried, while in despair on the shore, Evangeline stood with her father."" They lighted fires on the shore and the priest wandered from fire to fire, cheering and consoling, until he approached Evangeline and Benedict. Vainly Evangeline tried to cheer her father. Suddenly there is seen a light, which grows broader and higher and redder. The crowd cry aloud in their anguish, ""We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!"" Overwhelmed with the sight the priest and maiden gaze in horror. As they turn to speak to Benedict they find he has fallen, and lies motionless on the ground, his soul departed. Evangeline kneels at her father\'s side and wails aloud in her sorrow, ""Let us bury him here."" and the priest said, ""Lo, with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation solemnly answered the sea."" PART V: ""Many a weary year has passed since the burning of Grand-Pre."" Evangeline commences her endless search for Gabriel, cheered by the faithful Father Felician. Hearing that he is with Basil in the South, they start southward with a few Arcadian boatmen. Evangeline, cheered by a vision of Gabriel beckoning her onward, falls peacefully asleep. ""While all are slumbering, through the darkness a light, swift boat draws near and passes on the other shore."" it was Gabriel, who goes to the western wilds seeking, ""oblivion of self and of sorrow."" When they reach Basil\'s home they find him a prosperous herdsman. Basil goes with Evangeline to pursue Gabriel, leaving Father Felician to rest. Gabriel is always ahead; sometimes they find the ashes of his camp-fire. A Shawnee Indian woman leads them to the Mission of the Black Robe Chief, who tells them Gabriel was there six days before and will return again in the spring. Evangeline remains to wait, while Basil goes back to his home. Gabriel does not return, and at length, discouraged, Evangeline gives up the search, and becomes a Sister of Mercy. ""Fair was she, and young, when in hope began the long journey. Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended."" After many years a pestilence falls on the city, and Evangeline, in a hospital ward of an alms house, finds Gabriel, who dies in her arms. ""All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow."" Meekly she bowed her head and murmured, ""Father, I thank thee!"" In an old graveyard are seen two nameless graves, in which the lovers are sleeping, side by side. ""Still stands the forest primeval. Maidens still wear their Norman caps and kirtles of homespun, and by the evening\'s fire repeat Evangeline\'s story. While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.""::Moving Picture World synopsis', 'In the Canadian province of Acadia, young Evangeline is betrothed to Gabriel.

With bundle in hand he looks for work from town to town and in vain until he comes to the coal mines of Montsou. Luckily for him there is a vacancy because of a workman being absent, and the foreman, Maheu, hires him at the suggestion of his daughter, Catherine, who dressed as a man is wont to work like a man in the mine. Lantier creates an impression on her and she takes his part much to the chagrin of her accepted lover, Chaval, an unworthy and violent man. Lantier fails to recognize her as a woman until after sharing her lunch with him in the depths of the mine, her hair falls from under her miner's headgear. From that moment he devotes his whole heart to her. At the end of the day's labor Lantier, who has excited a fierce jealousy in Chaval, is invited by Maheu to become a boarder at his house and he joyfully accepts. The engineer, Negrel, making his daily descent into the mine finds the shoring timbers holding up the earth in a bad state and ready to fall. He makes a report recommending that the woodwork he immediately and properly repaired so as to avoid accident. The company, however, posts a notice saying that because the woodwork has to be repaired the price received by the miners per car of coal mined will be decreased. This arbitrary and unfair notice causes much discontent and anger among the miners. A mass meeting is called for at the Cabaret Rasseneur; Souvarine, an anarchistic workman, advocates violent measures. Lantier opposes this and suggests concerted action. The anger of the workmen breaks out afresh when they begin to receive their reduced wages and urged on by Lantier, whose influence is growing, they vote to strike. In the meantime Catherine, though in love with Lantier, dares not go back on her word to Chaval and marries him. Chaval treacherously carries full information of the strike proceedings to Mr. Hennebeau, the chief director of the company, and accepts pay for being a spy. The strike is now on amid general enthusiasm. In the meantime, Negrel, the engineer, who is in love with Hennebeau's daughter, pleads with Hennebeau to answer the miners' requests. Miss Hennebeau also pleads with her father, but in vain. The stores refuse to extend credit to the striking workmen and famine soon stalks among them. Lantier discovers to his surprise that Chaval is an exception and that he has plenty of food and money. As yet he has not discovered that Chaval is the paid spy of the company. Catherine brings secretly to her starving relative food and money. Chaval follows her, drives her from the house and strikes her. Lantier seeing it interferes in her behalf, and being attacked by Chaval thoroughly thrashes him. Chaval, taking advantage of the growing misery among the miners, urges some of them back to work. While they are in the mines the other strikers cut the elevator ropes. There is a panic in the mine depths. The imprisoned miners finally escape by ladders, but have to run the gauntlet of the enraged strikers, who still hold out. When Chaval is dragged from the mine Lantier rashes at him, but Catherine steps in between and prevents harm being done to her husband. Blinded by hatred Chaval goes to Hennebeau and denounces the miners' leaders, especially Lantier. The police are called upon to arrest him, but warned in time he escapes to the abandoned shaft of Voroux. The strike becomes violent and the troops are called in to reinforce the police. In the absence of Lantier, Souvarine is called in to head the strikers. Hennebeau's house is attacked and stoned. Seeing the soldiers preparing to fire on the mob, the director's daughter rushes from the house to try and avert the coming calamity. She is caught in the storm of bullets and dies together with many of the miners and their wives, among them Catherine's father. This crushes the strikers' movement and instigated by Chaval they vote to resume work. Lantier, emerged from his refuge, tries in vain to dissuade them, but his influence is gone and bowing to the majority he also goes back to work. Souvarine, alone implacable, determines upon desperate measures. He releases the bolts binding the barriers that hold back water from flooding the mine and the flood breaks loose. He is drowned in the cataclysm that follows. The miners, caught like rats in a trap, run madly hither and thither. Some escape, others, among them Lantier, Catherine and Chaval, are caught. These latter three find themselves imprisoned in an abandoned working pit, where they sit in despair with the water up to their knees. They have little food and when after long hours Catherine attempts to give a little of her lunch to Lantier. Chaval furiously opposes. Chaval finally attempts to deprive his wife by force of her morsel of food. In righteous rage Lantier strikes him and kills him. His dead body, floating on the water, haunts them.

This is related to Hamlet by his friend Horatio, who describes the spirit as much resembling the late King of Denmark, his deceased father, whom his Uncle Claudius is suspected to have murdered in order that the latter might usurp his throne. Uncle Claudius also married the queen, the mother of Hamlet, within a month after. Hamlet, moved by the narration of Horatio, determines to watch for the next appearance of the ghost. It is seen again at midnight, discloses itself to Hamlet as his murdered parent and relates to him the cruel circumstances of his cruel murder by the king, his uncle, and calls upon Hamlet to avenge it. In order to accomplish this purpose, Hamlet feigns madness, especially in his conduct towards Ophelia, daughter of Polonius, with whom he is enamored. Hamlet engages some players who enact a scene in the presence of the king and queen which displays the murder of his father, purposely to try the king. Claudius, on beholding this, stung by his conscious guilt and fearful of some outward event, determines to rid himself of his nephew by sending him to England. This project is aided by Hamlet, killing Polonius. whom he mistakes for the king and who was concealed behind the arras to listen to the conversation between the queen and her son, who had demanded an interview, Hamlet is by an accident made prisoner by some pirates as he is on his way to England but escapes and unexpectedly returns to Denmark. Previously, he discovers that the ambassadors are instructed by the king's letters to cause him to be put to death on his arrival in England. These letters he exchanges for others containing the same directions for the deaths of the ambassadors. During his absence, Ophelia, distracted through her father's death and her own misfortune, destroys herself, and her brother, Laertes, urged by false rumors concerning his father's demise, rebels against the king, but he abandons his intention on being told that Hamlet committed the deed. A stratagem is evolved by the king in which Laertes basely consents to kill Hamlet by secret means. Claudius wagers six Barbary horses against six French swords with Laertes that in a dozen passes he does not exceed Hamlet by three. Hamlet consents to make a trial and is first wounded by Laertes, who has treacherously used a poisoned weapon. In a scuffle they change swords and Laertes is himself wounded by the same deadly rapier. The king had prepared a poisoned chalice with which he determined to end Hamlet if Laertes failed.

This is related to Hamlet by his friend Horatio, who describes the spirit as much resembling the late King of Denmark, his deceased father, whom his Uncle Claudius is suspected to have murdered in order that the latter might usurp his throne. Uncle Claudius also married the queen, the mother of Hamlet, within a month after. Hamlet, moved by the narration of Horatio, determines to watch for the next appearance of the ghost. It is seen again at midnight, discloses itself to Hamlet as his murdered parent and relates to him the cruel circumstances of his cruel murder by the king, his uncle, and calls upon Hamlet to avenge it. In order to accomplish this purpose, Hamlet feigns madness, especially in his conduct towards Ophelia, daughter of Polonius, with whom he is enamored. Hamlet engages some players who enact a scene in the presence of the king and queen which displays the murder of his father, purposely to try the king. Claudius, on beholding this, stung by his conscious guilt and fearful of some outward event, determines to rid himself of his nephew by sending him to England. This project is aided by Hamlet, killing Polonius. whom he mistakes for the king and who was concealed behind the arras to listen to the conversation between the queen and her son, who had demanded an interview, Hamlet is by an accident made prisoner by some pirates as he is on his way to England but escapes and unexpectedly returns to Denmark. Previously, he discovers that the ambassadors are instructed by the king's letters to cause him to be put to death on his arrival in England. These letters he exchanges for others containing the same directions for the deaths of the ambassadors. During his absence, Ophelia, distracted through her father's death and her own misfortune, destroys herself, and her brother, Laertes, urged by false rumors concerning his father's demise, rebels against the king, but he abandons his intention on being told that Hamlet committed the deed. A stratagem is evolved by the king in which Laertes basely consents to kill Hamlet by secret means. Claudius wagers six Barbary horses against six French swords with Laertes that in a dozen passes he does not exceed Hamlet by three. Hamlet consents to make a trial and is first wounded by Laertes, who has treacherously used a poisoned weapon. In a scuffle they change swords and Laertes is himself wounded by the same deadly rapier. The king had prepared a poisoned chalice with which he determined to end Hamlet if Laertes failed. In the contents of this, the queen, unconscious that it is drugged, pledges Hamlet and is poisoned. Laertes, in the agony of death, confesses his own perfidy and accuses the king, and Hamlet, with the sword of Laertes, revenges himself by stabbing Claudius. The film concludes with the news of the death of Rosencrantz and Guilderstern through letters forged by Hamlet, and a eulogium oh the unfortunate prince by his friend Horatio and the choice of young Fortinbras for King of Denmark.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

John's greed was greater than his fraternal affection and he sought every means to support his claim on the crown against the time his brother, the rightful king, should return. There lived at this time also at Rotherwood, not many miles from where Sheffield now stands, a Saxon nobleman named Cedric. He was of the fast dwindling ancient Saxon race, but had refused the yoke of the invading Normans, at least in spirit. Wilfred, his son, rather favored the Court of King Richard, and Coeur de Lion rewarded him with the manor ""Ivanhoe."" Dwelling with Cedric was a beautiful Saxon girl of the blood royal named Rowena and it was Ivanhoe's lot that he should fall in love with his adopted sister, though the father objected on the ground that he had knelt to his enemies. Ivanhoe had subsequently Joined Richard the Lionheart in the Holy Land and the years passed on without news of him. Prince John bestowed Ivanhoe's barony on Reginald de Boen, a licentious Norman. Rowena is sought by Athelstane in marriage with the approval of Cedric. She refuses. Ivanhoe has returned from his adventures, and, disguised as a holy man, approaches his father and sweetheart in order to learn of their present feelings towards him. Still in disguise he meets Rowena and hands her a scroll in his own handwriting, and the girl is much pleased, for she has never forgotten her childhood companion. From here the scene changes to a forest where are seen two weary travelers trying to gain shelter before sunset. These are the wealthy Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York, and his daughter, Rebecca. The former is disguised as a poor peddler, the better to ply his trade of usury, without revealing evidence of his wealth. They are admitted to Cedric's mansion, though everyone shrinks from the old man, who is forced to eat his food by the fireside. Rebecca, a beauty, however, attracts the attention of de Bois Guilbert to the extent that he seats her beside him at the table and showers insulting attentions upon her. Ivanhoe, still in his disguise, comes forward to lend protection. Suspecting that the Jew has money the knights retire to complete plans to capture. Ivanhoe overhears, and, rushing to the Jew and his daughter, conducts them out of the castle. Immediately after they have passed out, the knight finds himself attacked on all sides by the conspirators, and though he makes a brave struggle to cut off the pursuit, he is finally left stunned and weakened by loss of blood. On recovering consciousness he observes his father and sweetheart, Rowena, being borne off captive, and too weak to succor them he drags himself into the forest and falls fainting again at the feet of Isaac. When he again regains consciousness it is to find that his new friends have vanished. Father and daughter, seeking water in the woods, have been captured as Ivanhoe's father and sweetheart had been. We are next taken into the camp of Robin Hood. A stranger has come into their midst and revealed himself to the leader as Richard the Lionheart, alone and sad, for while he is still the King of England he has yet to regain his throne. Robin and the Friar revive his moody spirits and it was the boisterous laughter of the Black Knight that attracted the faint Ivanhoe in the woods nearby. The meeting of these two characters is picturesque. Ivanhoe tells of his troubles and enlists the aid not alone of the King and Robin, but all his followers. There is a blast of the horn and from the hillsides a great army swarm down. The march is rapid, followed by a vicious attack upon the Torquilstone Castle, where the four are held prisoners. De Bois Guilbert is forced to leave off his attentions to the women and the torture of the miserable Jew to lead in the defense. In the press of the bloody battle is seen the stalwart form of Ivanhoe, while almost equal in prowess are the feats of the Black Knight. The Normans are forced back into their castle.

Eventually a mysterious crime puzzles him and his assistant, Fandor. To the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, he reports that the body of a woman, found in the house of Dr. Charles, cannot be identified. Papers bearing the name of Lady Beltham had been discovered in her clothing. Was the body that of Lady Beltham, the accomplice of Gurn, or was it the intention that people should believe that she was dead? Juve wondered why the body was found in the house of Dr. Charles. He concerns himself to watch the house, and the patience of Fandor and himself is unexpectedly rewarded. One day Dr. Charles leaves the house, and the car in which he rides is followed. Charles makes a false move. The man who leaves the closed car is not the Dr. Charles who got in. He is now a young man, with a black moustache, whereas Charles is a middle-aged man with a black beard. That is decidedly suspicions, and the detectives are in time to see him accept a note from a woman who is waiting for him. Instructing Fandor to follow the girl, Juve goes after the other man, known to the police as Lawrence, the leader of bandits. Following Lawrence (alias Charles) in a taxi, he is fated to lose his quarry, as an accomplice of the bandit punctures the tire of one of the wheels, and Juve is stranded in a street while Lawrence gets clear away. So far there is nothing to connect Charles, alias Lawrence, with Fantomas, alias Gurn. Fandor fares much better. The girl does not succeed in throwing the younger detective off the track and is apparently unconscious of the fact that she is being followed until she notices Fandor in the same compartment of the railway carriage in which she is traveling. Fandor tracks her to a house. Having seen her safely indoors, he sends a note to Juve, saying that he is keeping a good watch. Meanwhile, Lawrence has rend the note Josephine handed him, and he learns that an elderly man, confidential clerk in the employment of Messrs, Brown and Co., has fallen in love with her. That afternoon he is taking $30,000 to clients of the firm, and thinking that she is attached to him, wishes to take her with him on the journey. They were leaving the Gare de Lyon Station for Bercy by the Northern Express at three o'clock that afternoon. Would Lawrence be at the station with others of the gang? In consequence of the breakdown of the car, the note which Fandor had written did not reach Juve. Fandor, however, had waited near the house of the girl, and when she left, dressed as a lady, followed her to the Gare de Lyon, where she met the confidential messenger. No doubt there was a hidden meaning in this meeting, and Fandor decided to join the train; so did Lawrence and others of the gang whom he had gathered round him. The whole party traveled in the last coach of the train, and when the time bad arrived, one of the men climbed along the footboard and uncoupled the coach. Lawrence recognized Fandor, but his presence on the train made no difference to the plans of the bandits. As the coach began to fall away from the rest of the train, Josephine left the compartment in which a peremptory demand for the money be carried, whilst Fandor was also attacked. By this time the speed of the coach has very sensibly slackened and the gang easily escaped, fleeing in a motorcar waiting for them. In the car they examined the haul, and to their intense mortification discovered that the notes the man carried were all half notes, the remainder of which were to be handed to the clients of Brown and Co. when the contract was completed. When Fandor recovered from the shock of the attack he pulled the communication cord. To his consternation he found that not only had it been severed, but that the coach was running down the decline. He knew that the Northern Express was following the train in which he had traveled, and nothing but a miracle would avert a serious disaster. The coach ran back, and as the express began to cross the bridge the engine collided with the coach and the whole train was terribly wrecked.

With that purpose in view, he, in the name of Fandor, wires to Juve to come to the Bercy cellars of Brown and Co. the following night.

This undertaking, which at one time would have seemed difficult to him, becomes very easy, due to the friendship between himself and Colonel Julius Holbein, chief of the staff, and father of Elsa, for whom Swayne has shown a great deal of friendship, and in return he has Elsa's sincere love. After a dinner held at the Colonel's, during which the villain Swayne whispered sweet words of love into Elsa's ear, he succeeds in stealing the desired documents, and, protected by the darkness of the night, he escapes. Overcome by the sad reality, the Colonel is in a desperate state of mind. Elsa tries to efface from her mind her terrible suspicions, but in going to the hotel she learns of the sudden departure of Swayne, and her suspicions are confirmed. Colonel Holbein, to whom the precious document had been entrusted, is suspected as a traitor. This man shot himself for being so wrongfully accused.

One evening, while she is eating on the terrace of a hotel surrounded by ardent admirers, Marjorie is surprised at the sight of a young man, sad and pale like herself, who is observing her with a languid look. The pale young man is the Prince Arthur of Wallenstein, the son of the Grand Duke, who has come to the Riviera to recuperate from a long illness, under the name of Count L'Estrange. Surprised by the divine beauty and charm of Marjorie, he is a constant visitor at the theater. One morning they chance to meet and immediately they understand each other and a sense of sympathy seems to envelop their souls.

He finds her, pale and trembling. His eyes fixed upon her from his box in the theater. Suddenly Elsa observes his look. She becomes pale, trembles, and tries to control herself, but drops to the floor.

This undertaking, which at one time would have seemed difficult to him, becomes very easy, due to the friendship between himself and Colonel Julius Holbein, chief of the staff, and father of Elsa, for whom Swayne has shown a great deal of friendship, and in return he has Elsa\'s sincere love. After a dinner held at the Colonel\'s, during which the villain Swayne whispered sweet words of love into Elsa\'s ear, he succeeds in stealing the desired documents, and, protected by the darkness of the night, he escapes. Overcome by the sad reality, the Colonel is in a desperate state of mind. Elsa tries to efface from her mind her terrible suspicions, but in going to the hotel she learns of the sudden departure of Swayne, and her suspicions are confirmed. Colonel Holbein, to whom the precious document had been entrusted, is suspected as a traitor. This man shot himself for being so wrongfully accused. Elsa is asked by the Grand Duchy of Wallenstein to leave the Duchy, and is taken to one of the stations of the domain, where she is abandoned. Possessed of the qualities of a pianist and singer, under the false name of Marjorie Manners, she becomes famous. At her first performance she receives flowers from a large number of admirers, and long applause, but the memory of her father comes to her suddenly and that recollection takes away the joy of her triumph.

Modzel also had a son, Sigmund, who attended the aviation school and the two young men became fast friends. Adolph, after three months, became a proficient aviator and wrote to his parents of his progress. He also confessed that he had fallen in love with Helene, his host's daughter. But peace and harmony was destined to be disrupted. War was declared between the two principalities and Adolph was ordered to return to Bergstern. Sad indeed was the parting of the lovers, who vowed that the cruel war would not separate them for long. But fate smiled wickedly to herself. Helene fastened her locket to Adolph's watch chain as a token of her love. When Adolph arrived home, he immediately enlisted with the aviation corps and was ordered to destroy the enemy's balloons, if possible. Sailing through the air on his mission of destruction, he sent bomb after bomb into the enemy, destroying a dozen great balloons. Consternation reigned in Dawsbergen. Sigmund, who had enlisted with his country's aviators, was ordered to set out after the enemy's destructive aeroplane. Soon he sighted it and succeeded in gaining a position directly above it. He sent a bomb toward the other machine, which was struck and fell to the ground. Unhurt by the fall, Adolph ran for the shelter of a nearby mill. From this vantage point he succeeded in killing several of the enemy. Sigmund volunteered to capture the bold aviator, but fell mortally wounded. Lieutenant Maxim then commanded that the mill be blown up. The great structure came to the ground with a crash, and the lifeless body of Adolph was laid beside that of his friend. Neither had known that the other was his old comrade. Lieutenant Maxim reported the death of Sigmund to his bereaved parents, who sadly but proudly learned of his heroism. Maxim was smitten with the beautiful daughter, Helene, who waited in vain for news of her lover. One day Maxim told her that he loved her and asked her to marry him, but she told him that she could not give an answer to him then. As they were resting after a stroll through the wood, Helene was startled to see hanging from his watch-chain the locket which she had given to Adolph when they parted. Maxim then explained that he took it from the body of the man whom he had killed in the destruction of the mill. Beside herself with grief at the unexpected news, Helene was tempted to throw herself in a nearby lake. Hearing the bells tolling in a cloister nearby, she hesitated, and realized that the bells were calling to her. For the world had no place for her now, with her burden of grief and memories, and she made her way to the holy house. And oft in the twilight those memories come back to her of the days when peace reigned in the land and the terrors of war were unknown.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

We then see him go abroad to England, where he writes plays, and finally is forced to sell them all in a bundle to a producing manager for a few hundred dollars. He is shown at the height of his success, at his love affair with the widow of the poet Shelley and his subsequent flouting by that lady for his more successful countryman and rival in love as well as in letters, Washington Irving. His flight to France, his writing of ""Home Sweet Home,"" that deathless lyric, his return to the land of his birth, and at the last, his death while American consul at Tunis, alone, unhonored and unsung, and then his mother\'s death, disappointed and grieved that her beloved son had done so little for the world. Then, in a series of little slices out of life, are shown the mistake his mother had made in believing her son died, leaving nothing. The strains of Payne\'s immortal song have echoed and reechoed \'round the world and all classes and races of man and womankind have attuned their ears unto its message. First we see a little western frontier town with its one little lunch counter run by a young girl, ""Apple Pie Mary."" To the rough townsmen and the miners she is cold and harks not to their words of love, but instead, opens the floodgates of her heart to an eastern boy, on prospecting bent for gold. Her heart won, she would forsake this flower of the western highways for a stately beauty of the hothouses of eastern society, but the gentle strains of ""Home Sweet Home,"" played by the halting and stumbling fingers of a peripatetic miner minstrel, guide his wandering footsteps back into the paths of duty and real love, and he finds his ""Home Sweet Home"" in the calico covered arms of ""Apple Pie Mary."" A swift transition to another class of life, and there is seen where the walls of an apartment house are ruthlessly torn away and we see revealed a husband, elderly and past his prime, and his partner of life. The husband, immersed in the cares of business and no longer young, lavishes jewels and clothes and pleasures on his beautiful young wife, but she grows tired of them and fails to recognize the sterling worth of her husband and allows a younger and handsomer man to talk love lyrics into her ear while he urges her to leave her good but uninteresting and unromantic partner and fly with the younger Romeo, and seek unlawful happiness with each other. Torn by the struggles between her imaginary love of this youthful lover and her duty and respect for her husband, the young wife is about to leave her home when through the open window comes the haunting air of a violin. The air is ""Home Sweet Home,"" played by the master hand of a famous violinist to a chambermaid on the floor below. Its message is clear to the young wife, and she dismisses her cavalier and remains true to the man she had wed. A third shift on the great stage of life and is seen a poor old mother and her two sons, whom she loves and cherishes, but who are both very bad boys. One of them is fortunate enough to acquire some money, and the other covets it and attacks his brother. Both are carrying deadly hate in their hearts for each other, and in a fight to the death both are killed. The old mother is rendered insane with the shock and sits dry-eyed, shrieking aloud in her agony of heart, her very soul bared by the terrible tragedy that has come upon her, when the mellow tinkling of a guitar in the hands of a neighbor restores her to a reasonable being, and she finds peace and consolation in her faith in God. Needless to say, the mellifluous melody was ""Home Sweet Home."" Thus, in a series of life\'s dramas of smiles and tears, is shown the influence of the most beautiful and far-reaching of songs, and it is suggested in the play that Payne\'s mother at last realized that her son had made one great success of his life, though it was but to be the ever-living and deathless lines of ""There\'s no place like home.""::Moving Picture World synopsis', 'John Howard Payne leaves home and begins a career in the theater.

When Arbace\'s disciple is murdered Glaucus finds himself in hot water, shortly after which Mt. Vesuvius erupts.::Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>', 'PART ONE: Glaucus, a handsome and wealthy Athenian nobleman, living in the city of Pompeii, is the sweetheart of Ione, a Grecian girl of great beauty. Ione\'s brother, Apaecides, a young man of religious tendencies, is the pupil of Arbaces, a crafty, lewd, and unscrupulous Egyptian, high priest of the Temple of Isis. Arbaces has ever nourished an intense but unworthy love for Ione. The Egyptian despises the handsome Glaucus as his rival and plots his downfall. Nydia is a sweet-minded Thessalian flower girl, cursed with blindness at birth and madly loving Glaucus whom she has never seen, but whose kindly voice and ever-ready purse have many times lightened the hand of her cruel mistress, Stratonice, wife of Burbo, an innkeeper. With his friend, Sallust, Glaucus one evening goes to the tavern of Burbo to place bets on the coming gladiatorial contests. He there purchases Nydia from Burbo, after seeing the blind girl frightfully whipped by Stratonice. He takes her to his home. PART TWO: Arbaces writes a letter to Ione, suggesting that she come and visit him, and intimating that his magic can show her the falsity of Glaucus. Ione accepts the invitation and the Egyptian conjures up a vision, in which Ione sees Glaucus making love to other women. Overcome by emotion, Arbaces embraces her. An instant later he is felled by the heavy hand of Apaecides. Ione flees to the home of Glaucus, where Nydia, her heart torn with jealousy, ministers to the stricken girl. Meanwhile, Apaecides, his faith shattered, prepares to denounce Arbaces and renounce the creed of Isis. PART THREE: The following morning. Nydia goes to the Temple of Isis to seek solace for her aching heart. She meets Arbaces and confides her love to him. The crafty Egyptian promises to secure from the witch of Vesuvius a love potion, which, if administered to Glaucus, should make him love Nydia forever. Meanwhile, Glaucus and Ione, while strolling on the mountainside, are caught by the rain and seek refuge in the witch\'s cave. Glaucus brings down the curse of the sorceress by killing her sacred reptile and the lovers leave the cave in panic. Arbaces enters and has little trouble inducing the witch to give him a potion that ""shall sear and blast the brain, to make him idiot, raving mad, while yet the heart beats on."" PART FOUR: Nydia meets Arbaces, secures the ""love potion"" and gives it to Glaucus. The insane man rushes through the streets, reeling from side to side. Meanwhile, Apaecides has had a stormy scene with the Egyptian and goes forth to cool his fevered brain, to the seashore. Arbaces follows and murders him. At that instant the staggering form of Glaucus is seen, and the wary Egyptian promptly seizes him and, calling loudly for help, charges Glaucus with murder. Nydia, who, terror-stricken, had followed Glaucus, is seized by the Egyptian and carried away to his dungeons. Glaucus is haled before the Senate and condemned to die by wild beasts in the arena at the coming games. PART FIVE: The great day finally arrives, and the mighty stands are crowded with thousands of gay Pompeiians intent upon seeing the rare spectacle of a Patrician thrown to the lions. In her dungeon, Nydia plans escape. She plays upon the superstitions of her negro keeper and succeeds in locking him in her cell. Conscious that it had all been her fault, the blind girl frantically makes her way to the home of Sallust, friend of Glaucus, who had remained home from the great spectacle. PART SIX: The great spectacle was at its height. There had been parades of the gladiators and the people had howled themselves hoarse over the valor of the gladiatorial combats. Everything was in readiness for the great feature of the day\'s sport, the death of Glaucus. Already the people yelled impatiently, ""Glaucus to the lions,"" and the Athenian was given a short sword and roughly pushed into the Arena. The hunger-maddened lions sprang from their cages. Suddenly the wild, disheveled form of Sallust appeared, leaping from the boxes and shouting hoarsely, ""Remove Glaucus the Athenian. He is innocent. There stands the Murderer."" A guttural roar went up from the assembled thousands, in which could be heard excited cries of ""Arbaces to the Lions, Arbaces to the Lions."" At that instant the sky suddenly darkened and from distant Vesuvius there shot into the sky a shaft of hellish fire. Panic seized the multitude and pandemonium reigned. In the confusion Arbaces escaped. The frightful catastrophe restored the reason of the demented Glaucus. He felt the touch of Nydia\'s hand in his and felt her leading him through the blinding hall of cinders to the home of Ione. They found Ione prepared for death, but the gentle Nydia led them both through the Stygian darkness to the Temple of Isis. Here they met the distracted Arbaces and saw him crushed to death by a falling pillar of his own idolatrous church. Then, in a blackness where only the blind could see, Nydia guided the two lovers to the seashore. Knowing them safely aboard, Nydia suddenly threw herself into the waters of the bay. Her love-task ended, the blind girl at last found the eternal rest she sought.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

While the mob that has followed the fair stout lady are cheering her to the top of their lungs, Anton calmly removes his disguise, and distributes his business cards, and then they realize they have been tricked. In the meantime, Coletti has constantly mingled with the masses in various disguises. Then a celebrated police dog is put on the trail of Coletti. While Coletti and his sweetheart are enjoying themselves at a nearby café the crowd follows the police dog. The dog is on the scent, tugging at the leash with all his might he makes for the café. As they enter the café Lolette begins to dance, while Coletti goes into an adjoining room and changes back to his own clothing. Time has been flying fast; the mob has been watching in admiration the dancing of Lolette, then the inner door opens and a wild dash is made at the man who enters, Coletti himself, who calmly raising his hand, says, ""Yes, you have caught me, but you are five minutes too late.""::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Experiencing a series of visions, he sees murder as a normal course of events in life and kills his uncle. Tortured by his conscience, his future sanity is uncertain as he is assailed by nightmarish visions of what he has done.::Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net>', 'A baby has been left in the care of a bachelor uncle, who lavishes all his love and tenderness on his charge. He plans a great literary career for his nephew, for the boy has shown promise of future greatness. But he had reckoned without thought of a possible obstacle, woman. In the freshness of his youth, the young man meets a beautiful girl, whom he calls in the joy of his poetical nature, ""Annabel Lee."" The twain soon grow to love each other, with all the power which Poe has so vividly portrayed in his poems of the affections. But the old uncle, his heart set upon the boy\'s future, interferes. When ""Annabel"" calls to invite her young swain to a garden party, the uncle insults her by accusing her of pursuing his nephew ""like a common woman,"" Hoping thereby to prevent her ever returning. The insult sinks deep into her heart, and realizing that the boy\'s obligations to his uncle are too great to be honorably broken, the two decide to part forever. Meanwhile, however, the uncle undergoes a change of heart, as the young people, grief-stricken and all unknowing, say their final farewells. Now comes to the young man thoughts that are black and evil. It seems to him that all Nature is but a series of systematic murders. He sees the spider devouring the fly, the ants consuming insects of other kinds. Only that day he had been reading the poems and stories of Edgar Allen Poe, among them the story of ""The Tell Tale Heart."" If only the old man, his uncle, were out of the way, there might yet be joy and happiness with the girl he loves. To make all the stronger this powerful impression on his mind, his uncle has only one eye, just as had the poor victim in the story of ""The Tell Tale Heart."" Brooding over the tragic blackness of the impending separation, he forms a diabolical plan. With all the consummate skill of Poe\'s character in ""The Tell Tale Heart,"" the plan takes form and execution. It is then that the great and saving grace of conscience demonstrates its power. Avenging thoughts, such as Poe himself might have conceived, are visualized to the quaking youth. The subtle working of the inner conscience, beyond the power of mind to control, finds expression in the weird and terrible visions which torture the culprit brain. Relentless fate pursues him to the brink of the pit and then a sudden awakening proves that part of his mental disturbance is a dream, and the dream is what causes him to realize the horror of murder and to abandon the idea of it.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

When the Sheriff then loses the recovered money at a crooked roulette table, he and Stokes strike a bargain.::Maurice VanAuken <vanauken@comcast.net>', 'In the first scene, the country is alarmed by advice that Jim Stokes, the ""Two-Gun Man"" is in the neighborhood headed for the border, and warning is given to place a double guard around the stage on its trip through the canyon. The warning is timely, for Jim is planning to hold up the stage and obtain a package of gold on it consigned to the express company. The stage is seen traversing a winding roadway through the marvelous scenery of the Grand Canyon, and at an opportune bend in the route Jim cleverly holds up and robs the stage, extra guard and all. Jim has the lead in his attempt to escape, but his pursuers are close on his trail. He is wounded and his horse killed from under him. However, he manages to lose himself in the Bad Lands, and painfully makes his way to a spring, where he falls unconscious. From this situation Jim is rescued by Nell Brent\'s father, who takes him to their home, where Nell nurses him back to health. He falls in love with his pretty nurse, and without revealing his identity is married to her. Conscience-stricken, he determines to return the stolen money to the express company, and riding to the nearest station for that purpose, is horrified to find a poster announcing a thousand dollars reward for his capture. He is seen and recognized, almost immediately, and the sheriff organizes a party for that purpose even while Jim\'s horse is hitched at the railing of the store. He learns the intent, however, and again makes a daring escape with his pursuers crowding close behind. He rides his horse into a pool of water, to lose the trail, puts a note under the saddle for his waiting bride, and sends his horse home. Again he starts on foot, but is finally captured in a typical western hotel combining saloon, gambling rooms and dance hall. While waiting with his prisoner until train time, the sheriff is attracted by the revelry of the rooms below, and going downstairs, gets into the game and loses all of the stolen money he had just recovered from Jim. Returning then to his prisoner whom he had left in handcuffs the sheriff said, ""I\'m a bigger thief than you are, Jim Stokes. I\'ve lost the money you stole from the express company."" Seeing the sheriff\'s predicament, and wishing himself to be free, Jim proposes the bargain that if the sheriff will let him go, he will recover the money. This is agreed upon, and Jim\'s handcuffs are removed. He then arms himself, and going out through the window, enters the gambling room, and holds up the cashier. He gets the money, rushes out in the wildest excitement, mounts a horse, and is again pursued. The flight this time takes him to the edge of a great precipice with the posse at his heels. Without hesitation he chooses the plunge to capture and horse and rider are seen rolling over and over down the steep cliffside. Jim again escapes, covers his trail and reaches the hotel just in advance of the searching party. He enters the room in a semi-fainting condition, turns over the money to the waiting sheriff, is handcuffed, and hastily tumbles into bed just as the party comes to the door and gaining admittance, explains that the game had been held up and they thought in some way Jim might have escaped and ""turned the trick."" The next day the sheriff starts with his prisoner, but safely away from the town, he looses the handcuffs, gives Jim two hours\' start to get his bride, and wishes him good luck, thus fulfilling his part of the bargain. Jim returns to Nell, is forgiven, and together they go across the border to another state.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

One night, in the final scene of the play, she and her comrades throw confetti into the audience, nearly blinding a young man who sits in one of the front rows of the orchestra. Dolly's sincere concern over the accident amply atones for it, and the young man, Steve Hunter, induces his friend, a wealthy young chap, to take him behind the scenes after the performance. There he and Dolly meet, and their romance begins. Though not a devotee to the theater himself, Steve is not long in falling in love with little Dolly, and one night, after the lights of the theater are dimmed, they are made man and wife. One day Steve receives word that an old uncle in the West is dying and that he is to come to him immediately. Steve goes, and Dolly now gives all her heart and energy to her work, succeeding so well that when an accident happens one day at rehearsal to the leading woman, Dolly is given that exalted position and told to be ready that night. She hurries home, her heart full with the success so near at hand, to find Steve has returned from the west, the heir to his dead uncle's great wheat farm. She hears Steve's news, hardly conscious of what it means, and then quickly tells him of her own good fortune; but instead of congratulating her, Steve tells her she will have to abandon her position on the stage and go west with him. After a terrific struggle between ambition and love, Dolly yields, surrenders her career and leaves all behind her to go west. But she soon wearies of the quiet farm and Steve's seeming neglect of her for his work, and one day, revolting against it all, she returns to the city. There she finds a wealthy man only too ready to back her as a star in a new play. Trying to forget Steve, she throws her whole soul into her ambition, and the new play and star become the sensation of the theatrical season. But success without Steve to share, it turns to ashes in her grasp, and when that night the wealthy producer of the play comes to her dressing room, locks the door and demands the price of her triumph, she for the first time realizes the nearness of the abyss and its yawning terrors. As she desperately plays for time she hears Steve's voice. The manager hastily gives up the key, and she admits Steve while the other conceals himself. Steve, however, learns of his presence in the room, pulls him from his hiding place, and, with one glance of scorn at Dolly, leaves without hearing her explanation. Despairing and disillusioned, Dolly resigns from the case and takes the next train for the west. In the golden harvest fields, on a sunshiny day, she again meets Steve and tells him all, and as his forgiving arms embrace her the tawdry glitter of the tinseled past is forgotten.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

The scenes in this picture are laid during the days of '49, when the intrepid frontiersmen battled with the Indians for supremacy and when the scalp of man, woman or child of the white race was the token of an Indian's bravery and right to be called a man. Tom is in haste not only because the carrying of the mails require swiftness, but because he wants to see Sally, his sweetheart. He arrives within a short distance of the village where Sally lives when his attention is attracted by a dust cloud and the thunderous clamor of an approaching buffalo herd. He spurs his horse to reach the village before the herd passes as he does not want to be cut off, but his eagle eye discerns a swiftly moving, girlish figure ruining in front of the madly stampeding buffalo in an endeavor to escape them. Tom dashes in pursuit and after a desperate and breathless struggle, seizes the exhausted girl, and dashes on just ahead of the approaching buffalo. It is not until after this has been accomplished that he recognizes Sally, who rewards his gallantry and bravery with a warmth of affection that makes him all the more in love with her. In the village the story of the rescue is told, but it is considered an incident and of no considerable importance, because the hazards of frontier life are taken as a matter of course. Tom unstraps the mail pouch and there are letters for several of the settlers. Among them is a letter for Luke, Sally's brother. He reads it and with unconcealed fright and dismay, gives the letter to Sally. Tom helps her to read it. The letter is from Sally's father, Col. Madison, who is in the California gold fields. He writes and says that he has ""made his strike"" and is getting rich; that Sally's mother is very ill and Sally must reach her bedside as speedily as possible. Col. Madison appeals to his son, Luke, saying, ""Remember the vow you made to bring Sally to us."" He encloses a bag of gold dust. Lazy, shiftless Luke has forgotten his promise. He reiterates the excuses which he has made to Sally before, and declines to take her to the gold fields to join their parents. The exhibition of the bag of gold dust from the California mines, has excited the lust for riches in the breasts of all.

As he stands by the side of a tree, alert and listening, a silent arrow wings its way within an inch of him and buries its head in the tree trunk. An Indian creeps up behind him, springs on him and they engage in a desperate hand to hand struggle until Tom, at last victorious, hurls his assailant over the precipice. He then rushes to the camp and gives the alarm. But the Indians are there in great force.

The Indians dash into the camp and proceed to scalp their victims, while Tom and Sally pretend to be dead. Then Chief Swift Wind, who is in command of the war party, notices that the two are alive. They are taken to the camp as prisoners. Chief Swift Wind falls in love with Sally while Starlight, the Chief's sister, becomes enamored of Tom. The Indians having heard great things of the prowess of intrepid Tom, determine to compel him to run the gantlet, a frightful ordeal which consists in compelling the prisoner to dash at full speed between two lines of Indians armed with tomahawks, spears, clubs, etc. If he succeeds in running the gantlet that is passing through the lines of Indians he is permitted to escape. But few prisoners accomplish this. Starlight has hidden horses where Tom can find them and notifies him of this fact before he begins running the gantlet. Tom attempts unsuccessfully to escape and take Sally with him. Their captivity continues for a long period. At times they almost succeed in getting away only to be recaptured. Chief Swift Wind tries to win Sally, while Starlight his sister, falls in love with Tom. Were it not for these conditions both would have been slaughtered long ago. Sally and Tom escape finally to the camp of a band of buffalo hunters, but their camp is attacked by Indians, and it seems as though they are to be ""wiped out"" by the redskins, until Sally, volunteering as a messenger, makes her way to another large camp of buffalo hunters and brings them to the rescue. In the meantime, Starlight has followed the fortunes of Sally and Tom, and it is with her aid that the massacre of the party is averted.

The Indians dash into the camp and proceed to scalp their victims, while Tom and Sally pretend to be dead. Then Chief Swift Wind, who is in command of the war party, notices that the two are alive. They are taken to the camp as prisoners. Chief Swift Wind falls in love with Sally while Starlight, the Chief\'s sister, becomes enamored of Tom. The Indians having heard great things of the prowess of intrepid Tom, determine to compel him to run the gantlet, a frightful ordeal which consists in compelling the prisoner to dash at full speed between two lines of Indians armed with tomahawks, spears, clubs, etc. If he succeeds in running the gantlet that is passing through the lines of Indians he is permitted to escape. But few prisoners accomplish this. Starlight has hidden horses where Tom can find them and notifies him of this fact before he begins running the gantlet. Tom attempts unsuccessfully to escape and take Sally with him. Their captivity continues for a long period. At times they almost succeed in getting away only to be recaptured. Chief Swift Wind tries to win Sally, while Starlight his sister, falls in love with Tom. Were it not for these conditions both would have been slaughtered long ago. Sally and Tom escape finally to the camp of a band of buffalo hunters, but their camp is attacked by Indians, and it seems as though they are to be ""wiped out"" by the redskins, until Sally, volunteering as a messenger, makes her way to another large camp of buffalo hunters and brings them to the rescue. In the meantime, Starlight has followed the fortunes of Sally and Tom, and it is with her aid that the massacre of the party is averted. Sally and Tom make their way at last to the gold fields where her father and mother receive her with open arms and gallant Tom is awarded the prize of her hand.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Despite several tests of the strength of their friendship, they remain loyal to each other and so impress Dionysius that he allows them both Free."", ""The scenes open on the Island of Sicily, four hundred years before the dawn of the Christian era, when Greece was in the height of her marvelous power and glory. The story opens in Syracuse, a city governed by a body of Senators. Dionysius, its chief of generals, covets the throne and is strongly opposed by the senator, Damon. Among the generals of Dionysius, Pythias is his favorite, for through his valor many laurels have been added to the fame of his chieftain. The friendship between the senator, Damon, and the warrior, Pythias, is a matter of note in Syracuse. Pythias goes to visit Damon at his villa near the city. The wife and son of the latter greet him, and the boy is delighted when the soldier presents him with miniature replicas of his own helmet, sword, shield and chariot. Meanwhile, in Syracuse, Dionysius sees Calanthe, daughter of Arria and the affianced of Pythias, and desires her as his own. Tablets come to the general from Agrigentum, stating that the city is being attacked by a horde of Carthaginians and its destruction is feared. Dionysius is asked to come with his armies or send a trusted general in command. Still coveting Calanthe, a vision of her dancing among the maidens, comes to the General, and he decides to send Pythias to battle, hoping that he may not return. Heedless of the pleas of Calanthe, the soldier, Pythias, leads his men to the besieged city. Fate, not favoring the plans of Dionysius, gives to Pythias victory. Calanthe, fearful of her lover's safety, seeks an oracle and in its black cauldron sees a vision of her beloved surrounded by a grateful people. The head of his legions, Pythias, returns to Syracuse a conquering hero and is greeted by the admiring populace. Fetes and games are arranged in his honor. A chariot race is announced and Dionysius, still plotting, pits Aristle, the best charioteer in all Sicily, against Pythias. The race is run and Pythias is the victor and again the hero of the hour. So great becomes the soldier's popularity that Dionysius again desiring to destroy Pythias' fame, schemes to ascend the throne. Pythias' wedding to Calanthe is set for the following day. Taking the time as auspicious, knowing that Damon will be absent from the Senate to attend the ceremonials of his friend, Dionysius plots with Philistus, president of the Senate, to be offered the crown. The Senate assembles. Philistus proposes to choose Dionysius as king. The minority protests and dispatches a messenger for Damon. The tyrant is crowned. Damon, banishing all thought of self in his desire to keep Syracuse a free state, attempts to assassinate Dionysius. He is thrown into prison when Pythias, summoned by a slave, begs Dionysius for pity. Damon asks to go and see his wife and child. Pythias becomes his hostage. Damon is given until sunset to return. Accompanied by his faithful servant, Lucullus. the Senator goes on horseback to his villa. Then to his friendship comes the greatest demand, to bid a last farewell to his wife and son and returns to set Pvthias free while he dies upon the scaffold. Damon tears himself from his loved ones only to find that the too-faithful slave, hoping to detain him, has slain his horse. Syracuse is three leagues away. Damon attacks a soldier and takes his steed. The horse falls and is unable to go farther. Damon speeds on afoot. Meanwhile, Dionysius, disguised, endeavors to test the friendship of Damon and Pythias. Calanthe, unsuspecting, goes with him to Pythias, and through her the plotting king tempts the young soldier to flee, telling him that Damon shall not return. Pythias struggles with self, his desire for freedom, his love for Calanthe, but his friendship for Damon triumphs. He will face death rather than dishonor. Sunset's hour arrives. Crowds gather about execution place. Pythias lays his head upon the block. The axe is lifted to strike just as Damon, exhausted and weak, falls into the arms of his friend. Throwing off his disguise, Dionysius commands the heralds to announce the pardon of the Senator, refusing to sunder such a friendship as that of Damon and Pythias.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

There is no clue, however, to the identity of the murderer, and the police are unable to discover any. Even the shrewd special detectives assigned to the case are baffled by the mystery. Henry Duval, prosecuting attorney and close friend of the murdered man, resolves to untangle the skein of conflicting evidence and locate the guilty man. In spite of the fact that he has of late suffered intensely from nervous trouble, which includes increasingly frequent periods of mental aberration, he foregoes his vacation and remains in the city to probe the mysterious killing of his friend. He is the more interested because he himself is the last person known to have seen the man alive, as he left the judge on his own doorstep late night of the murder. Duval soon learns that a sentimental friendship existed between the judge and Mrs. Lea Morrel, wife of a prosperous businessman. When he learns, too, that Morrel was aware of this acquaintance and had forbidden his wife to meet the judge, he himself immediately suspects the husband's guilt. He places detectives on the watch and soon is in possession of a strong chain of circumstantial evidence which seems to establish beyond all shadow of doubt the fact that Morrel, impelled by jealousy of his wife, was guilty of the deed.

On the day before the trial of Morrel he calls upon Duval and asks permission to question him, a request which is readily granted. Under the careful examination of the scientist, the truth is gradually brought home to Duval, that he himself is suspected of having dealt the blow that ended the life of his friend. The skilled questioning slowly causes him to remember a number of his own actions, things which he had done without even realizing at the time that he was doing them, until at last a vision suddenly flashes before his eyes; a vision of himself in the act of striking down his companion on that fatal night. The terrible knowledge that he is guilty of the very crime for which he is prosecuting Morrel strikes him like a thunderbolt; the blow is too much for his weakened nervous system, and he falls dead at the feet of his inquisitor.","['Helder is a happy family man, but one day his wife receives a letter from her brother Albert, who managed to escape from prison.', ""Judge Edward Martin, a criminal court magistrate, is found dead on a street corner early one morning, and the investigations of a coroner's jury definitely establish the fact that he was murdered.

He becomes convinced that the killing was done by someone during a period of mental irresponsibility and that the murderer did not know what he was doing at the time. Learning of the prosecuting attorney's mental trouble, and considering the fact that the official was with the judge on the evening of the murder, he sets himself to investigate the case in good earnest. On the day before the trial of Morrel he calls upon Duval and asks permission to question him, a request which is readily granted. Under the careful examination of the scientist, the truth is gradually brought home to Duval, that he himself is suspected of having dealt the blow that ended the life of his friend. The skilled questioning slowly causes him to remember a number of his own actions, things which he had done without even realizing at the time that he was doing them, until at last a vision suddenly flashes before his eyes; a vision of himself in the act of striking down his companion on that fatal night. The terrible knowledge that he is guilty of the very crime for which he is prosecuting Morrel strikes him like a thunderbolt; the blow is too much for his weakened nervous system, and he falls dead at the feet of his inquisitor.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

Her only playmate was Hans Schmidt, a shepherd boy. Learning of an approaching flower festival in a nearby town, the two children decided to decorate their dog-cart and enter the contest for a prize. Great was their surprise and delight to be awarded the first prize. Then came the folk-dances, in which all the children took part. None among them was more graceful than Gretchen and Hans, who were partners. Their charm and grace did not escape the attention of Herr Zimmer, the director of a theater in Amsterdam. He complimented the two children and gave Gretchen his card, telling her to call on him if she should decide to go on the stage. The next day, during a severe storm, Gretchen's father was struck by lighting and killed. Deprived of his support, her mother decided to take advantage of the director's offer and sent Gretchen to Amsterdam. The two children were broken-hearted to be thus separated and at the first opportunity Hans followed his little sweetheart to the big city. But the stern hand of his mother interfered with his romance and he was compelled to return home. Six years rolled on and Gretchen had become a celebrated dancer. In her new life she had traveled afar and forgotten all about the little village. Hans, however, never forgot the sweet days of old and often sighed for his little playmate. Hearing that she had returned to Amsterdam after a long and successful tour, he decided to call and see her. But she cared not to resume her friendship with the rustic shepherd and refused to receive him. She had become enthusiastic about ballooning and often expressed a desire to make an ascension. One day an opportunity came and amid the plaudits of her friends she rose into the air. She was accompanied by a young man, to whom she was engaged to be married. When they were at a great height, their balloon was suddenly caught in a terrific storm. Absolutely helpless, they were buffeted and swirled by the awful wind and rain. With a terrifying flash, a bolt of lightning struck the huge gas-bag and with a report like the crack of doom, the balloon burst into flame and shot like a meteor toward the earth. Gretchen and her fiancé were found unconscious by the villagers and removed to a hospital. For many days their lives were despaired of, but they finally recovered. Gretchen, however, was doomed to perpetual darkness, as her eyesight was totally destroyed. No longer then did her lover come to her, and she found herself abandoned by all her admirers. But her fond old mother came for her and took her back to the old home. When Hans learned that Gretchen was home again, he called to see her and was horrified to hear of her great misfortune. Loyal to the last, his great love and sympathy conquered everything. Taking her in his arms he vowed that he would never leave her again. And Gretchen realized then the true love and loyalty of her shepherd sweetheart.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

Her trunk is nearly packed to go on the boat for her return to Spain. She hides Jarvis in trunk and he is taken on board the boat. In the meantime, Jarvis has telephoned to Rusty, his colored servant, to procure tickets. Two detectives enter and search for Jarvis, but fail to find him. He goes to Spain to help the Princess recover her treasure. Before the Princess goes to America, her father, who enters the castle which is supposed to be haunted, but in reality the ghosts are only the tools of the Duke dressed in armor and as ghosts, is killed by the Duke's men who also capture her brother and hold him prisoner. Jarvis, upon his arrival in Spain, starts with Rusty, his servant, to explore the castle. While at the inn near the old castle, the Duke steals the locket from the Princess' bag and tells Robledo, his tool, to keep Jarvis away from the castle. The Princess learns that the locket has been stolen and tells Jarvis. Jarvis starts to go out, when Robledo appears with drawn gun. He and Jarvis both fire. Jarvis seriously wounds Robledo who, on his death bed, tells the Princess about the castle and also about her brother. The brother, who has escaped by diving into the same place where the Duke's tools killed the Princess' father, swims the moat and escapes on the horse Jarvis rode to the castle. He notifies the police, who come to the castle. They are about to seize the Duke when he jumps down the trap and is killed. Jarvis and the Princess then each discover a mutual desire to possess the other and the story ends with the pair pledging their troth.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

Through the fasting and hardships of the vigil he hopes to gain supernatural strength which will make him a chief not less powerful than his father, Kenada. First upon a mountain\'s peak he builds a prayer-fire to the Gods. After long dancing about the sacred flames he drops from exhaustion and in vision-sleep the face of a maid appears in the coiling smoke, thus breaking the divine law which forbids thought of women during the fasting. Now he must pass another stronger ordeal. Leaving his desecrated fire to go to the Island of the Dead he meets Naida, the maid of his dream, and woos her. She tells him she is promised to the hideous Sorcerer. Motana bids the maid return to her father and say that when this vigil is over he will come with a wealth of presents and beg her hand in marriage. Now he renews his quest of spirit power and tests his courage by spending the night in the fearful ""house of skulls."" And to prove his prowess he goes in quest of sea-lions and then performs the greatest feat of all, the capture of a whale. Then, for his final invocation to the Gods, Motana again builds his sacred fire upon the heights. While he fasts and dances there about his sacred fire the Sorcerer, in a dark glade of the forest, has gathered about him fellow workers in evil magic and they sing ""short life songs"" to destroy him. The Sorcerer sends his daughter to find Motana and in some way get a lock of his hair, that they may destroy his life by incantation. This plotting woman, on seeing Motana asleep by his fire becomes infatuated with him and decides to risk even the wrath of her Sorcerer father and win the love of Motana. When she awakens him with caressing words, he bids her begone, as he is not thinking of women, but of the spirits. With angry threats she departs, but in stealth watches the faster until he drops asleep, then creeping up steals his necklace and a lock of hair, and disappears. Motana, returning, asks his father to send messengers demanding the hand of Naida. Her father, Waket, replies to the messengers, ""My daughter is promised to the fearful Sorcerer of Yilis. We dread his evil magic. We also fear Yaklus, the head hunter, the brother of the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer is proof against knife and spear and arrow. Yaklus and his clan know no conqueror."" The followers of Motana and Kenada prove that the power of the Sorcerer cannot avail against the wrath of the raven clan, who are determined to rid the region of the head hunters. The head of the Sorcerer they bring to prove his death. But unknown to them, Yaklus, the head-hunting chief, has escaped. In great pomp of primitive pageantry Naida and Motana are married. Yet even while the wedding dancers make merry, a cloud of tragedy hangs over them, for Yaklus and the survivors of his village are thirsty for vengeance. Enraged at the death of his brother, the Sorcerer, he runs ""pahu-paku,"" and is really Yaklus, ""the short life bringer."" In his magnificent high-prowed canoes he starts upon his war of vengeance. It is his law that the war party destroy all who are met, whether friend or foe. While on their foray fishing parties and travelers are encountered. Then they make their night attack upon the village of Motana. Kenada and his tribesmen give way before the infuriated Yaklus, and amid the smoke and flames of the burning village Motana is wounded and Naida is carried away to captivity. Yaklus, returning to his village, gives a great dance of victory. The frenzied warriors demand the life of Naida. Yaklus bids her come and dance for them. If she dances well enough to please him he will spare her life. If not, they will throw her to the ""hungry wolves."" So well does she dance that Yaklus spares her. In the sleeping hours Naida sends her fellow captive slave with a token and message to Motana, who has been revived by surviving medicine men of his village. When he receives the message from his bride-wife Motana calls for volunteers. By stealth he rescues her. Yaklus in rage starts in pursuit. Motana, hard pressed, dares the waters of the surging gorge of Hyal through which he passes in safety. Great was his ""water magic."" Yaklus attempts to follow but the raging waters of the gorge sweep upon him and he and his grizzly followers become the prey of the evil ones of the sea.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

As in all the other titles in this Thanhouser collection, organist Ben Model exhibits the demanding and skillful art of improvisation.', ""Jacob, the Hebrew patriarch, had twelve sons, but the one he loved the best was Joseph, who was next to the youngest. Joseph was more obedient than the others and his father, impressed by his filial devotion, made him a coat of many colors. This sign of the father's preference angered the older brothers and they grew to hate Joseph. The older brothers journeyed away from their home with their flocks, and Jacob sent Joseph to them with a message. When Joseph came to his brothers they seized him and cast him into a pit. A caravan passed on its way to Egypt and the cruel brothers sold Joseph as a slave. The caravan took Joseph to Egypt, while the brothers, dipping Joseph's coat in goat blood, brought it to their father, telling him that they could find no trace of Joseph. Jacob, grief -stricken, believed that his son had been devoured by wild beasts and would not be comforted. When the caravan reached Egypt. Joseph was sold as a slave to Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh's guard. His master treated him kindly and placed him at the head of his household. But Potiphar's wife, resentful of Joseph's authority in the household, turned Potiphar against him and Joseph was cast into prison. In the prison Joseph's charity and kindness was enjoyed by all the inmates. Even the stern keeper liked him and gave him many favors. And when Pharaoh, wrathful at his chief butler and baker, decided to punish them it was into this prison that they were cast. The chief butler one night dreamed of a vine with three branches, which budded and blossomed, and from the clusters ripe grapes came forth, and that he took the grapes and put them in Pharaoh's cup and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. He asked Joseph the meaning of this dream and Joseph told him that in three days Pharaoh would restore him to his place. The chief baker also dreamed. In his dream he had three white baskets on his head, and in the top basket there were bake-meats for Pharaoh, and birds ate them out of the basket. Joseph, asked for the interpretation, said that within three days Pharaoh would hang the baker. And on the third day both predictions were fulfilled, and the chief butler, restored to his place, speedily forgot about Joseph. Two years have passed since the chief butler left the prison to return to Court, when Pharaoh himself had a curious dream. He believed he stood by the river, and that seven fat cattle came out of the river, and they were followed by seven lean cattle, who devoured the fat cattle. And he dreamed again that seven good ears of corn were devoured by seven thin ears. None of the Egyptian scholars could tell the monarch what the dreams signified, but the chief butler suddenly remembered the young slave in the prison and told of his prophesies. Pharaoh sent for Joseph and when he appeared before him, related his dreams and asked what they signified. Joseph told Pharaoh that there would be seven years of great plenty in Egypt followed by seven years of famine. He advised that Pharaoh appoint a capable officer to collect food during the years of plenty so that when the years of famine arrived, there would be provisions to sustain his people. Pharaoh, greatly impressed by Joseph, declared that there was no one as capable as he and appointed Joseph ruler over all of Egypt. During the seven years of plenty Joseph had great granaries filled with corn and other provisions so that when the years of famine followed, Egypt, unlike the other countries, would not suffer. But in the land of Canaan where Joseph's father and brothers lived, the food was scarce, and hearing of the abundance in Egypt, they journeyed there. Joseph recognized the brothers who had treated him so harshly, although they little dreamed that the personage could be their long forgotten brother. He gave them corn, questioned them as to their families, and then, keeping one of his brothers as a hostage, bade the rest return to their homes, telling them that if they desired more corn they must bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, with them. Benjamin was the brother whom Joseph loved the best. The brothers returned in dejection to their homes and told Jacob, their father, what the great lord has said. The supply of food was soon exhausted and they returned to Egypt, taking Benjamin with them, Joseph received them and gave them the food they asked for, but he ordered a servant to secretly place one of his costly cups in Benjamin's bag, and then, when the brothers had journeyed some distance from the city, Joseph's guards overtook them.

Holofernes is as merciless as nature to all who fail. The great leader's brutality of his captains when they do not succeed in carrying the fortress by storm indicates what the inhabitants of Bethulia may expect in the event of capture and serves to intensify the clash of character later on - it adds peril to the undertaking of Judith when she resolves to sacrifice herself for her people.

He leaves the palace dressed as a hunter and goes to a far corner of the Principality. There he meets Katrina, the daughter of an innkeeper. Katrina is so winning and wholesome, just the kind of girl that the Prince has not been used to, that he asks if he can secure a room at the inn. He is accommodated and finds that the more he sees of Katrina the more he hates to leave and go back to the old life. Finally the court becomes impatient at the absence of the Prince and sends couriers to find him and persuade him to return. Katrina's brother has taken the Prince to task on account of his interest in Katrina and hot words pass. Raolf attacks the Prince, not knowing who he is. While the struggle is taking place Von Tromp enters and Raolf is astounded to learn that they have had the Prince as their guest. The diplomatic relations between Saxe-Tholberg and Austrania have been strained owing to some trouble over the boundary, and war is imminent. The Ambassador of Austrania, anxious to secure the plans of Saxe-Tholberg, corrupts one of the officers of the Saxe-Tholberg army and meets him at the inn kept by Katrina's father. Their conversation there is overheard by Katrina and her brother, who enter the room and accuse the officer of being false to his country. The Austranian Ambassador attacks Raolf. Katrina secures a weapon and accidentally shoots the Ambassador. Two officers who have accompanied the Ambassador enter. They seize Raolf and accuse him of the crime. Raolf is arrested and condemned to death in spite of the protests of Katrina, who tells the court that she did the shooting, and of the plot which they discovered. The Saxe-Tholberg officer, however, had escaped and taken the papers with him, so there was no proof of Katrina's story and the sentence of death is ordered to be carried out. Katrina makes a last appeal to the Prince, who pardons Raolf. The Austranian Nation demand satisfaction, but not being able to get it, declare war. In the ensuing war the forces of Saxe-Tholberg are not very successful in a crucial battle the leader of the Saxe-Tholberg forces is wounded and the flag is shot from the flag pole. Becoming demoralized, the Sax-Tholberg army is about to retreat when the Prince calls for a volunteer to raise the flag. The pole is on a small hill which is swept by the fire of the enemy, and it means almost sure death for one who makes the attempt. Raolf starts out but is killed before he attains his object. Several others make the attempt but are not successful. Finally Katrina offers herself and in spite of the protests of the officers and of the Prince, rushes from the house toward the standard. The very boldness of the attempt being made by a woman ensures its success, and the wavering forces of Saxe-Tholberg rally and drive the enemy back. Katrina's reward is that which falls to the lot of many patriots who offer their life for their country's good.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

But it is not until great odds have been conquered and much has been sacrificed that the goal is reached. And then it is too late. The odds are ridicule, poverty and lack of education. The great sacrifice, love. A chance meeting, in his hoodlum days, with Arthur Morse, a college man, proves the turning point of his life, for through him he meets Arthur's sister Ruth. This means the opening of a new world, and in the remaining reels of the play we see Martin's indomitable spirit and the development of his career. He makes two picturesque friends. One is Russ Brissenden, a poet, who encourages Martin when he sorely needs it, though his taking the latter to the Socialists' meeting had unfortunate results for the cub reporter as well as for Martin. The other is Maria, his warm-hearted Portuguese landlady, whose wildest flight of imagination, """"hoe all da roun' for da kids,"" Martin later is happily able to gratify. A third figure comes now and then into Martin's life: beautiful, wistful Lizzie Connelly, who loves him and whom he pities but cannot love. As in so many lives, matters are at their lowest ebb before the tide turns. Martin is penniless and without food or warmth.

Even Love, in the person of the repentant Ruth, knocks at his door in vain, and he sails for the South Seas, to find again, if he may, his old-time zest for life.","['From a hard-won leadership of a hoodlum gang in Oakland, Cal., from a beach-comber\'s life in the South Seas, and from the inferno of the stokehole, Martin Eden, an unlearned sailor, wins his way to fame and fortune. But it is not until great odds have been conquered and much has been sacrificed that the goal is reached. And then it is too late. The odds are ridicule, poverty and lack of education. The great sacrifice, love. A chance meeting, in his hoodlum days, with Arthur Morse, a college man, proves the turning point of his life, for through him he meets Arthur\'s sister Ruth. This means the opening of a new world, and in the remaining reels of the play we see Martin\'s indomitable spirit and the development of his career. He makes two picturesque friends. One is Russ Brissenden, a poet, who encourages Martin when he sorely needs it, though his taking the latter to the Socialists\' meeting had unfortunate results for the cub reporter as well as for Martin. The other is Maria, his warm-hearted Portuguese landlady, whose wildest flight of imagination, """"hoe all da roun\' for da kids,"" Martin later is happily able to gratify. A third figure comes now and then into Martin\'s life: beautiful, wistful Lizzie Connelly, who loves him and whom he pities but cannot love. As in so many lives, matters are at their lowest ebb before the tide turns. Martin is penniless and without food or warmth. He has had only one sale of a manuscript in the many months of unceasing endeavor. Brissenden is dead. Ruth, losing her faith, has broken their engagement and refuses to see him. Then comes the sudden sweep of success, with publishers clamoring for his work and fame and wealth in his hand. But the tension that sustained him during his days of poverty and struggle breaks. Even Love, in the person of the repentant Ruth, knocks at his door in vain, and he sails for the South Seas, to find again, if he may, his old-time zest for life.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

They have both become to hate war and all that it means and they live in the hope that there will not be any war in the near future. But their hopes were in vain, for it was not long before a war was declared and the husband was called to arms. His wife was sick at the time and her two misfortunes together, nearly caused her death. This conflict was of short duration, however, and soon they were happily united again. The hostilities were long enough though to arouse deeper disgust for war on Tilling's part, because of the manifold horrors he had seen on the battlefield. And Martha's great sorrow in having her beloved husband snatched from her in the hour when she needed him most, had made her the more bitter against war. Consequently, she persuaded her husband to resign from the service but no sooner had he written his resignation, than he was compelled to change his mind. His wife received a letter from her bankers, notifying her that her fortune was lost, and as they now had only his salary on which to live, he could not resign from the service. Thus the horror of war began to make itself felt on all sides, it being one of its evil results that swept away their fortune, through the failure of their bank. The last conflict still fresh in their minds, a new war broke out, and Tilling was called again to the front This time the strife was prolonged and desperate. Tilling's regiment was in the thick of the fray where the battles were fierce and disastrous. His regiment was finally routed, with terrific loss of life. The wounded were quartered in available places: barns, churches, railroad stations and the like. While Tilling was visiting one of these barns, it was struck with a huge shell, which destroyed the barn, killing most of its occupants and injuring Tilling as he sought to escape. He was rushed to the railroad station and sent by train to his home. Meantime, Martha, who had not heard from her husband for so long, feared that he had been wounded or killed, and started for the seat of war to search for him among the injured. She disembarked from the very train that carried her husband back to the city. She met the family physician who was at the front and, together, they visited all the field hospitals. She was horrified at the sight of so many maimed and dying men. When she failed to find her husband, she returned home and was overjoyed to find him there, alive, and his wounds not serious. Happiness now reigned supreme for this happy family. Martha's sister, Rosa, became engaged to her cousin, Conrad Von Althaus. All had forgotten war until alas, another of its inevitable terrible effects interrupted their contentment. Cholera, which had spread from the battlefield, attacked their house. First a maid contracted it and died. Then Rosa developed the dreaded disease and died. Her aged father was grief-stricken and after her funeral he died, but before the end he renounced his belief in war and prayed for peace, as Martha and her husband pledged themselves to the same cause.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

His first visit is to Sam\'s office, discovering the place dismantled, he now believes Blake\'s story and starts for the shore, gun in hand, intent on killing Sam Warner. He gets there just in time to see the young couple embarking on Captain Ben Wilson\'s boat. He, by this time, has been wrought to such a state of mind that he would stop at nothing. He makes for the light house just as a storm is blowing up. As he enters the light house, he sees his older brother Nathaniel about to fill the lamp and light it to guide the boats through safety during the storm. He points the gun at his brother and threatens to kill him if he attempts to light the lamp. There a fight ensues and Nathaniel gains possession of the gun, and rushes to the light house tower and lights the lamp. During this time the boat with Sam and Helen on has been tossing about on the rough waters. When the rays from the light house are seen by those on the boat, they are much relieved to find that they have miraculously escaped the reefs. There is a lapse of a year and a half. The picture shows Christmas Eve in the old homestead. Martin, who has always felt reproachful for his treatment towards Nell is sitting at a table quietly thinking of the past, while the children are jumping around the room in happy anticipation of what Santa Claus is bringing them. Nat steals into the kitchen and sends the children to bed and then asks Martin\'s aid in helping to fill their stockings. Martin goes about it half-heartedly at first, but gradually enters into it with the holiday spirit. Nat then leaves the room and reappears with Nell and Sam and the baby. Martin is overjoyed at the reunion.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Before their return to Alaska on the following spring a plot is hatched in Washington, D.C. to juggle the Alaskan land laws in such a manner as to rob all the rich miners of their property, and to that end a corrupt judge is appointed with instructions to obey the orders of Alex McNamara, the genius of the entire conspiracy. The judge is dispatched to Nome at once, but on the eve of sailing from Seattle, he is taken ill and is forced to entrust certain important documents to his niece, Helen Chester, who thus becomes the innocent agent of the conspirators. Helen sails, but en route to Nome smallpox breaks out on the ship and she is threatened with thirty days quarantine. She manages to escape, with the assistance of Glenister and Dextry, who have taken passage on another ship. The two men are ignorant of the nature of Helen\'s errand, and gallantly fight and defeat her pursuers, then smuggle her on board their own ship and protect her until she arrives at Nome, where she delivers to Struve, McNamara\'s agent, the secret papers entrusted to her. Glenister, who has fallen in love with the girl, saves her life in a street brawl at risk of his own, then secures living quarters for her with the wife of his mine superintendent. In due time Judge Stillman and McNamara arrive in Nome and with the help of Struve\'s rascally firm begin their machinations. The new faction shortly assumes control of all the mines, including the ""Midas,"" and Glenister, because of his love for Helen, prevents the miners from using violence against Judge Stillman and prevails upon them to let the law take its course. Cherry Malotte, the beautiful dance hall girl, returns from Dawson City, discovers Glenister\'s love for Helen and determines to combat it. In this she is assisted by the Broncho Kid, a gambler and an outcast, who has recognized in Helen Chester his own sister, whom he has not seen since boyhood, and who misinterprets Glenister\'s feeling for Helen. Glenister and Dextry find that the Nome court will grant them no relief and decide to send their lawyer, Bill Wheaton, back to San Francisco with an appeal to the Federal courts. To secure money for this purpose they arrange to rob the sluices of their own mine, which they succeed in doing, but are saved from capture by Helen, who recognizes Glenister in time to send McNamara\'s men on a false trail. Later the Broncho Kid suspects Glenister of the robbery and advises McNamara to search his cabin before there is time to conceal the gold, but Cherry learns of the plan and with her quick wit foils McNamara\'s effort. Wheaton returns from San Francisco with a writ from the Federal court which Stillman refuses to recognize, thus making plain the nature of the conspiracy. Becoming fearful of outright violence McNamara undertakes to remove the gold dust taken from the Midas and other mines to a place of greater safety, but Glenister and his friends storm the bank and are prevented from taking forcible possession of the gold only by the timely arrival of troops summoned from the nearby post. For a second time Wheaton is dispatched to the States for aid from the superior courts. Meanwhile Glenister becomes convinced that Helen has been a conscious accomplice of ""The Spoilers"" and intends to marry McNamara, so in a reckless mood he spends a desperate night in the Northern gambling hall, playing faro. The Broncho Kid, who is dealer, plots to ruin Glenister with the assistance of Cherry as ""case keeper."" At the crisis of the game, when his money is gone, Glenister wagers his interest in the Midas and is prevented from losing only by Cherry\'s declaration that, ""the cases are wrong."" Cherry saves Helen from a drunken miner and learning her identity, prompts her to suspect the truth of the situation in which her uncle figures. Realizing the great wrong that she has helped to do, Helen undertakes to remedy it, and overhearing the judge and McNamara arranging for Glenister\'s immediate arrest, she finds him and enables him to escape with a posse at his heel. With the aid of Cherry Malotte, Glenister makes good his flight, summons his friends, and decides to make an end of the looting of the mines by destroying them with dynamite, thus checking McNamara\'s activities until Wheaton can invoke further aid from the Federal courts. Wrapped in a world of mystery and uncertainty Helen appeals to McNamara\'s accomplice, Struve, who offers to put her in possession of the truth if she will go with him that night to a distant roadhouse for supper. Conscious of her peril Helen agrees. The miners, under Glenister\'s leadership, dynamite the Midas and defeat their enemies in an exciting battle in the midst of which Glenister hears of Helen\'s danger and rides headlong to her rescue. He arrives only to find Struve badly wounded and to hear that Helen has gone away with the Broncho Kid. Heedless now of all save Helen\'s safety Glenister rides into town and there encounters McNamara at Struve\'s office, where the latter had gone to destroy the documentary evidence of the conspiracy. The two men fight a terrific hand-to-hand battle in which Glenister triumphs. Wheaton arrives in time to effect the arrest of the conspirators, on instructions from the Federal court and Helen produces the proofs of guilt which she had secured from Struve. Justice is done and Helen confesses her love for the man she had helped to wrong.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Charlie, a city chap, wanders into range and receives an unusually large block in the middle of his face. Tillie, seeing the stranger is in distress, drags him to her home. Here the stranger discovers that Tillie's father has a bank roll. With threats and promises, he induces her to get the money and go to the city with him. Their first stop is at a cabaret, where Tillie takes the first drink of her young life. Things go along smoothly until they are disturbed by a pretty young damsel, named Mabel, who has followed them since their arrival in the big city. She turns out to be Charlie's city girl, and he, on getting hold of the money that Tillie kept on her person, leaves with her. Tillie imbibed too freely and was put out into the street. She was then arrested and thrown into jail. Her jailers, discovering her name to be Tillie Banks, telephone to the big millionaire of the city, Douglass Banks, and find that she is his niece whom he has never seen. She is escorted to her uncle's beautiful mansion and here creates such a scene that her uncle disowns her and orders her from the house. No place to go, she looks for a job and secures one as a waitress. Her uncle, being much distressed by the incident, goes away to do some mountain climbing to forget it. Here he takes a terrible fall and his guide, thinking he is dead, telephones to Mr. Banks' secretary, who immediately goes looking for Tillie, who is the only known living relative. In the meantime, Charlie has made use of the bankroll by dolling up Mabel and himself and they are taking life easy. He and Mabel one day wander into the restaurant where Tillie is working and Tillie, meeting the one who is the cause of her downfall, faints. Charlie and Mabel make their escape, and sitting down in the park to rest, Charlie buys a newspaper, which tells him of the hunt that is on for the missing heiress, Tillie Banks. He immediately sneaks away from Mabel and goes back to the restaurant and explains matters to Tillie's satisfaction and drags her off to a minister, where they are married. On going back to the restaurant they are met by the late millionaire's secretary, who makes known to Tillie that she is an heiress. The heiress and her newly-acquired husband proceed to their new home, the Banks' mansion. Here they entertain lavishly and a few days later give a grand ball. This ended in a frightful fracas, through the machinations of Mabel, who has managed to secure a position as maid in the household. In the midst of the melee the uncle, who was found to be only slightly injured, returns and has the whole party thrown out into the street. Charlie, discovering that Tillie has nothing in the way of worldly goods, renounces her, and grabbing Mabel's hand, off they go pursued by the now vengeful Tillie. In the excitement that ensues the police of the city are called out as well as the river police, as Tillie has pursued the recreants to the water front, and here in the midst of all the excitement Tillie is struck by an automobile loaded with policemen and she, automobile and load take an awful drop into the river below. Here Tillie is finally rescued and Mabel, seeing the destruction the conscienceless Charlie has wrought, falls into Tillie's arms, imploring her forgiveness, and they both renounce Charlie, as he is dragged away by the police.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

Sally makes another raid, is caught by Giles, who, from threats, took pity and accompanied her to the forlorn church, where his better nature is aroused. Returning to the garden, they breakfasted al fresco. This acquaintanceship finally ripened into a friendship. During one of their wanderings they happened upon a gypsy camp, where she was told that she will marry a nobleman's son. Giles bought a wishing ring from the gypsies which he gave to Sally. Naturally superstitious, Sally easily construed coincidences as replies to her wishes on the ring. At Annesley's party, Sally and the parson discovered through a letter which the Earl sent, that Giles is his son and must earn a half crown before he can hope for forgiveness. They were astounded and treated him quite deferentially. Sally resolved to bring father and son together. She visited the old gent and the Earl was quite impressed with her. She played chess with him, amused him, in fact she became quite essential to him. Her quixotic nature was aroused by the sight of his suffering and wished his cure on the ring. Getting no results, she consulted the gypsies who told her that a certain herb plucked by the light of the moon at midnight and made into a tea is a sure cure for gout. She obeyed the instructions and in reaching down the face of the cliff, fell down and was injured. The following morning a party led by her little dog found her at the bottom of the cliff and took her to her home. The next morning at ten, when the Earl's little visitor failed to appear, he sent his butler to inquire. On learning that she was injured, he forgot his gout, ordered his horse and set forth to see her. His horse became lame; he stopped at the inn, ordered a fresh horse, which, by a coincidence, was furnished by Giles, who received a half crown. As the innkeeper gave Giles the money, he told him that Sally had been injured. Giles took a short cut, arrived before his father, told her of the half crown, hid when his father appeared, and when beckoned on by Sally (who in the meantime had earned the gratitude of the Earl by telling how she was injured) he emerged from his place of concealment, and she brought about the reconciliation.","['After being expelled from college, Giles runs away from home and meets a young lady who he falls for.::Sin Jack', 'Sally, a parson\'s daughter, though in rags and well-ventilated shoes, had artistic instincts and the two vases, though far too rich for her father\'s church, were flowerless.

On his return home to father, the latter placed him in the hands of a tutor, from whom Giles escaped and arrived at his friend Annesley\'s rose garden at the psychological moment when the gardener had tendered his resignation. Annesley gave him the apron and placed him in charge of the garden. Sally makes another raid, is caught by Giles, who, from threats, took pity and accompanied her to the forlorn church, where his better nature is aroused. Returning to the garden, they breakfasted al fresco. This acquaintanceship finally ripened into a friendship. During one of their wanderings they happened upon a gypsy camp, where she was told that she will marry a nobleman\'s son. Giles bought a wishing ring from the gypsies which he gave to Sally. Naturally superstitious, Sally easily construed coincidences as replies to her wishes on the ring. At Annesley\'s party, Sally and the parson discovered through a letter which the Earl sent, that Giles is his son and must earn a half crown before he can hope for forgiveness. They were astounded and treated him quite deferentially. Sally resolved to bring father and son together. She visited the old gent and the Earl was quite impressed with her. She played chess with him, amused him, in fact she became quite essential to him. Her quixotic nature was aroused by the sight of his suffering and wished his cure on the ring. Getting no results, she consulted the gypsies who told her that a certain herb plucked by the light of the moon at midnight and made into a tea is a sure cure for gout. She obeyed the instructions and in reaching down the face of the cliff, fell down and was injured. The following morning a party led by her little dog found her at the bottom of the cliff and took her to her home. The next morning at ten, when the Earl\'s little visitor failed to appear, he sent his butler to inquire. On learning that she was injured, he forgot his gout, ordered his horse and set forth to see her. His horse became lame; he stopped at the inn, ordered a fresh horse, which, by a coincidence, was furnished by Giles, who received a half crown. As the innkeeper gave Giles the money, he told him that Sally had been injured. Giles took a short cut, arrived before his father, told her of the half crown, hid when his father appeared, and when beckoned on by Sally (who in the meantime had earned the gratitude of the Earl by telling how she was injured) he emerged from his place of concealment, and she brought about the reconciliation.::Moving Picture World synopsis', ""The ne'er-do-well son of the Earl of Bateson, Giles, is expelled from college for carousing, his father refuses to forgive him until he can prove himself worthy by earning half a crown. He then goes to the estate of Mr. Annesley where he accepts the position of gardener. While there, he meets and falls in love with Sally, the daughter of a poor parson, who has been stealing roses for her father's church. When Sally learns that Giles and his father are estranged, she vows to bring them together. She goes to the earl and charms him, becoming his trusted companion. When Sally is injured trying to pick some herbs to cure his gout, the earl goes to see her, first stopping at an inn where he gives the groom a half crown for helping his horse. By coincidence, Giles is the groom and in the end, having proven himself worthy, he marries Sally with the earl's blessing.::Pamela Short"", 'Giles Bateson is expelled from college for misconduct. His angry father, the Earl, sends him a message: ""Never let me see you again until you have earned a half crown and proven yourself worthy of confidence."" Giles meets Sally, the parson\'s daughter, who believes Giles to be the gardener. On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a ""magical ring."" Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl\'s party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil\'s Cliff, but when Sally doesn\'t return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.::Fiona Kelleghan <fkelleghan@aol.com>']"

However, a phony clairvoyant, The Great Gilmore, finds out about John\'s intentions and tricks him into revealing where the gold is. When John finds out what happened, he decides to break out of prison and take care of matters himself.::frankfob2@yahoo.com', 'The career of Bad Jake Kennedy\'s gang comes to an end in the town of Clayton, after months of robbing banks and express companies of thousands of dollars. The pursuit by the sheriff and posse ends in a corral, where the gang, cornered, fights till only four are left. Of these, ""Buckshot John"" Moran is wounded, and carried by Doc Pattee to his own office. The others are locked in the jail, from which they are dragged by the indignant populace and duly hanged. Too late the citizens realize that they have destroyed all means of locating the cache where the gang\'s rich loot is hidden. Only Buckshot John is left, and he emphatically declares he does not know where it is. At intervals during the first fifteen years of his thirty-year sentence in the State\'s Prison at Canon City, every means is taken to make him tell, but he stoutly reiterates his denial. One of the methods is ""religion,"" which, though it fails, proves the means of opening a new life to the sullen and embittered convict. In the truest sense, this former desperado ""gets religion."" He prays for a message, and, putting his finger haphazard on a page of the Bible, reads the words: ""A clean heart."" From that time on his one thought is ""to go clean when my time comes,"" and he prays for a way to restore the securely hidden money to its rightful owners. Meantime, in Denver, ""Dr. J. Buchanan Gilmore"" has risen by devious, shady paths from being a vendor of snake oil and a fake clairvoyant to an unassailed position as leader of the cult of the hour, ""Purified Thought."" The interest of a high official puts the stamp of approval on his career, and he is quick to take advantage of it, bringing the fact to the attention of a reporter sent to cover a story. This reporter is ""Jimmy Dacey,"" much in love with the statesman\'s daughter, Ruth, a state of affairs viewed with disfavor by her father, who much prefers the rich and polished Dr. Gilmore as a suitor for his daughter. Affairs look very badly for Jimmy as Gilmore\'s half-hypnotic influence over Ruth becomes stronger. Sent to try once more to get a confession from Buckshot John, with the usual fruitless result, Jimmy gives him a newspaper, and is greatly surprised at the convict\'s statement that his only reading matter is his Bible. Buckshot reads of Gilmore\'s marvelous psychic powers and of a private exhibition in which messages were received from the dead. It seems like an answer to prayer, and he sends a note to Gilmore begging help. A convict must have had newspaper notices, and in the office of Jimmy\'s paper Gilmore drains the files clean of everything that had ever been printed about Moran and the Bad Jake Kennedy gang, and goes to Canon City with a well-filled notebook. Gilmore, pretending to go into a trance, preys on Buckshot John\'s mind and emotions, with voices, messages and mysterious sounds, till the broken and half-hysterical convict tells the location of the cache, and begs Gilmore himself to get the money and restore it to its rightful owners. Hiding his wild exultation at thus getting possession of the fortune, Gilmore suavely reassures Buckshot, and returns home to make preparations to steal the money. A casual glimpse of Gilmore in the file room was added fuel to the flame of Jimmy\'s jealous suspicions of him, and when the latter says goodbye to Ruth on the plea of a sudden trip to San Francisco, and is seen taking a local train toward Canon City, Jimmy camps on his trail, goes to the prison and learns from Buckshot that Gilmore had been there several days before and had told him wonderful things. Jimmy quickly disabuses poor Buckshot of that illusion, suspecting that he and Gilmore were planning to divide the hidden treasure between them. Buckshot stolidly denies that he told Gilmore his secret, but after Jimmy\'s departure nearly breaks down as he realizes that his prayers have been in vain and that now he can never make reparation. One chance remains: to catch Gilmore at the cache, so, sacrificing all his good-conduct credits, Buckshot makes his get-away. He catches up with Gilmore, who is laden with the stolen money, forces its return, and makes his way to Denver, where he gives the money to a committee of clergymen, then happily awaits the coming of the police to take him back to prison. ""I couldn\'t get an honest man, so I had to do it myself,"" he naively tells Jimmy. How Jimmy traces Gilmore\'s part in the transaction and uses his knowledge to force Ruth\'s father to consent to her marriage to himself, and to do a great service to Buckshot John, completes this story.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

The call to arms comes, and he leaves the fields to take up his weapons of war. In contrast to this scene is shown a dinner at the castle belonging to Mahmud Hassan, a great Turkish Bey, who is also leaving for the front to fight for his country. These two introductory scenes are followed by a view of the Battle of Lule Burgess, during which the Montenegran peasant is slain and the Turkish noble is taken prisoner of war. For a time Mahmud is in prison, but he is later taken to a Montenegrin village with other captives, who are to be allotted to the bereaved women of the district as servants to do the work of the slain or absent men. Mahmud is allotted to Sonya, the sister of the peasant Martinovitch, and she leads him to her cabin, literally driving him, whip in hand. Sonya, partly as revenge for the death of her brother, decides to treat Mahmud in the most humiliating manner possible, taking the horse out of the plough and forcing him to drag it himself and also compelling him to do unaccustomed menial tasks of cooking and washing. Mahmud, who has given his parole to Sonya, accepts the bitter situation with a touch of humorous restraint. His only friend is the little crippled brother, who has immediately taken a fancy to him. In the end Mahmud revolts and Sonya finds that her captive is really the master. Little by little Sonya finds herself coming to regard the captive in a more friendly light, for his courtesy, strength and courage are vast forces of attraction. They do not confess the fact, they both come to realize the growth of a mutual sentiment. When affairs have reached this stage a band of Turkish soldiers capture the nearby village, get drunk in the tavern and go foraging. The officer takes a fancy to Sonya, drags her into the house and tries to kiss her. Mahmud rushes to the rescue, and the Turkish officer, at first delighted to see him, says that he will set him free. However, when the officer indicates that he wants Sonya the two men immediately clash. Mahmud throws the officer out of the house which he then barricades, intending to fight a forlorn hope. The Montenegran reinforcements fortunately arrive in time to prevent a catastrophe of a serious nature, but Mahmud is wounded by a shot fired by the officer whom he has defied. Mahmud, regretting that he cannot marry Sonya because of their different stations in life, now returns to his Turkish castle, but is greeted on his arrival by a soldier from the Sultan who hands him a proclamation confiscating his lands and its title for resisting his superior officer.

Passing through the United States they have met Eve Bertram, a very wealthy woman, and are visiting her at her country home. The younger brother, Alexis, determines to secure Eve's fortune by marrying her, but Eve's brother, Guy, a wealthy amateur who is working for his degree in chemistry and experimenting with high explosives, sees through the Russian's matrimonial plans and is angry with his sister for permitting Alexis's attentions.

Guy's valet, Nogi, is an agent of the Japanese secret service and by spying, discovers that Alexis has the map. The Russians are to leave that night and Boris, feeling that his own matchmaking scheme moves too slowly advises Alexis to press his suit even if it means missing his steamer, and that he, Boris, will go to London and negotiate with the agents. Alexis reluctantly gives Boris the map. Guy and Christine quarrel about Boris's attentions to her. Boris gives Christine an old Russian coin as a keepsake, which Christine, to show that she doesn't care for it, fastens to Guy's watch fob. Boris leaves early, while Alexis, against the wishes of Guy, remains with Eve, saying he has plenty of time. Alexis is that night murdered in the sunken gardens of the Bertram estate. The next morning Christine discovers the body and tells Guy. Nogi hears the news and also the telegram Christine sends Boris telling him to return. The country police and villagers trample the grounds, obliterating any marks that might he helpful. There are no finger prints on the body and his jewelry is intact, including his watch, which stopped at 11:05. Eve Bertram, frantic with grief, telegraphs for the best detectives and offers a reward of $10,000. Detective Williams arrives and finds THE CLUE, a Russian coin, and also proves that Alexis has been strangled. Christine is about to acknowledge the coin as the one Boris gave her when Guy stops her with the statement that he killed Alexis. He says that when they met on the stairs the previous night he struck Alexis and threw him down. Christine insists that it was an accident but Guv points out that nobody will believe him and that it will kill his sister. Both Christine and Guy deny knowledge of the coin and Boris also denies that he has ever seen it. Afterwards Boris tells Christine that he knows Guy killed his brother, and says that the price of silence is that she shall marry him, to which she consents. Boris then blackmails Guy, saying that he knows who killed Alexis. The price for silence in this case is first Guy's money and then his life, which he must take himself. Williams now learns from Nogi, who is anxious to keep Boris around until he can get the map, that the coin belongs to Boris. Williams finds clues leading both to Boris and Nogi, and accuses Boris just as Christine announces her engagement to him. Guy starts to kill himself but is prevented by Christine, who declares that she loves him and who concurs in his decision to tell Williams everything. Meantime, Williams has left Nogi and Boris together and is listening through the window, hearing enough to convince him that Nogi is the murderer. Nogi offers Boris his freedom for the map. Boris refuses and they fight. Boris is getting the upper hand when Nogi throws a lighted cigarette into the powder in the laboratory. The explosion kills the Russian outright and injures Nogi so badly that he dies. Christine finds the map and destroys it for Nogi.

The law is often taken in hand by individuals having differences of opinion. The White-Renlow feud started over a little matter. A pig belonging to the Renlows is found by Bill White eating his turnips. He makes complaint to Jim Renlow, and an angry discussion arises. White is further incensed by the fact that he sees Tilden White making love to Alice Renlow, Jim\'s pretty daughter who is the community\'s school teacher. He leaves in anger, and on his way home sees Peggy White talking to young Renlow. White follows young Renlow and shoots him. The feud is underway, and a White will shoot a Renlow on sight, and vice versa. News of this trouble reaches Louisville, and the editor of a paper there sees a chance for a good story. The star reporter is ill, so that the editor sends a ""Cub"" into the mountains. Thus it happened that Steve Oldham had his adventure. Steve leaves the train at the nearest point to Whitesburg, where the feud is being carried on, and makes the rest of the journey on a donkey. His arrival in Whitesburg causes great commotion, because of his fashionable clothes. He goes to the hotel, and in order to get any news must identify himself with the White family, as he is in their midst. The plain daughter of the landlord, Becky King, decides that she wants to marry Steve. Unfortunately for Becky, Steve meets Alice Renlow and is smitten with her. He calls for her every day after school. This causes comment from the Whites because Steve is supposed to be a White and ""is keeping company"" with a Renlow girl. It makes Tilden White jealous of Steve. To pay the teacher\'s salary a dance is given in the schoolhouse. It is called ""A Truce Dance,"" because to get enough money it is necessary to draw on the pocketbooks of both Whites and Renlows. Unless there were a truce, they would fight. Steve causes commotion by appearing in a full dress suit, but he makes himself popular by contributing twenty dollars toward Alice Renlow\'s salary. In recognition of his generosity he is made ""Floor Committee."" The duties of this office consist in standing by the door and shooting all who enter without paying. Steve does not care for his job. The worst is yet to come. Becky comes in and insists on making love to Steve. To get rid of her he kisses her. Alice enters in time to see it, and when Becky goes out to tell everybody that Steve is going to marry her, he makes up with Alice, and Becky and the people come back just as Steve is kissing Alice\'s hand. The Whites demand explanation. So do the Renlows. Thus Steve has both families down on him. He kisses Alice and tells everybody that they ""can go to hell."" In the confusion Steve escapes. Everybody chases him, but he sneaks back to the school house when it is empty. He is later captured by the Renlows when he is attempting to liberate Jim Renlow, who has been captured by the Whites. It now looks bad for Steve. It is decided that he shall be given to the Whites in exchange for Jim Renlow. The Whites want to kill him for throwing down Becky. He is saved, however, by the coming of the militia, sent by the governor to make the feudists behave themselves.

Years later David gets heavily involved in Italian politics and incurs the enmity of the corrupt Italian Prime Minister, which leads him to discover the hidden secrets of his family's past--and present.::frankfob2@yahoo.com"", ""The story opens with the suggestion of sorrow involved in the sudden discovery by Leone, a young officer of the Papal Guards, of the tragic death of his wife, who, believing herself deserted by Leone, places her infant at the door of a convent and throws herself into the Tiber. This seeming desertion was made apparent by the young guardsman's abrupt and continued absence from Rome, who, unknown to his wife, was sent on a foreign mission by his father, in order that his daughter-in-law, whose marriage to his son he has never countenanced, may be convinced of his infidelity, with its fatal result. The despairing young guardsman, at last aware of his father's cruel ruse, abandoning all worldly honor and position, seeking only forgetfulness, enters the monastery to devote his life to a sacred peace, and years later becomes Pope Pius XI. The abandoned infant, David Leone, is tenderly reared by the kind Sisters who find him, and when about nine years old falls into the hands of a cruel and heartless Padrone, who takes the boy to a den in London, where a number of other boys of his own age are imprisoned by the Padrone, and compelled to beg and steal in London streets. In this sullied atmosphere the delicate and refined boy is confronted with his first misfortunes, inhumanly starved, beaten and tortured, and taught vice and evil, which, however, he never truly embraces. On a cold, stormy day, little David, weak and exhausted by exposure after begging for hours in the snow, falls in a faint on the stoop of the home of Doctor Roselli, an idealist and political exile from Italy, who maintains a school in London and devotes his life to the youths of his country. There the good doctor finds the boy, and takes him into the house, where he tells Roma, his little daughter, that he has brought a brother home for her. The two children become inseparable companions, and Doctor Roselli instills in David's heart the principles and republican ideals which he hopes some day will liberate his beloved country. These doctrines fill David's soul with a vast longing for the political regeneration of his native land. As the picture proceeds David and Roma approach maturity. The benevolent doctor has departed from the world, and Roma is now the ward of Baron Bonelli, Prime Minister of Italy, who, through political intrigue, has confiscated and retained the estates of the exiled doctor. David, inspired by the teachings of his benefactor, has become a socialist leader and the idol of the people. For years David and Roma have not seen each other. A number of distinguished guests have assembled in the loggia of Baron Bonelli's house to witness the gorgeous procession of the Pope's Jubilee. Roma is surrounded with state and luxury. The Baron has fallen madly in love with her, and it is commonly known that she is his mistress. A short distance from the loggia David Leona, now a member of the House of Deputies, and known as David Rossi, is exhorting the multitude. A revolution is imminent unless some heed be taken of the necessities of the people, and David is resolved to interrupt the processional cortege by throwing himself before the Pope in an effort to gain an audience. As the procession approaches he is heard from the loggia addressing the people, denouncing Baron Bonelli, and also Donna Roma, to whom he alludes as a woman who holds illicit relations with the Prime Minister, and who enriches herself at the expense of the suffering people. The guests take their leave, and Roma and Bonelli are left alone. She is bitterly resentful of Rossi's insinuations. A plan of revenge comes to her, and she requests Bonelli not to molest him and leave his punishment to her. The Prime Minister acquiesces to Roma's request. Donna Roma visits Rossi in his apartment, whither he has been borne by his enthusiastic followers, and in the course of the conversation he is baffled by a strange resemblance between Roma and a girl he knew in the past. As the story develops. Donna Roma's studio is disclosed, where she indulges her fondness for sculpture. Here Rossi comes daily to sit for a portrait bust of himself that Roma is at work on. A passionate love has sprung up between them, and Rossi has told Roma all the secrets of his past, through which is also disclosed her identity as the little Roma of his childhood. But Roma has no longer any intention of securing his downfall. All ideas of revenge have long faded from her mind, and she has learned to love Rossi. David Rossi publishes a proclamation announcing a great meeting of the people at the Coliseum. Baron Bonelli, in the meantime, has ordered the police to charge the meeting, open fire upon the agitators, and in the confusion to kill Rossi, and thus rid Italy of him forever. Roma learns of this plot, and just as Bonelli's order is about to be executed, she arrives at the Coliseum, and throws herself before Rossi to shield him from the expected attack. In the resulting panic Roma and David flee to safety. They are hastily and secretly married and connive at David's immediate escape from Italy. Baron Bonelli hears of the marriage and scornfully asks Roma whether she confessed her true relations with him to David. He urges her to annul the marriage, but she tells him that her life now belongs to David. One of the charming scenes that follows is that in which Roma visits His Holiness, Pius XI, in the Vatican Gardens. On the promise of immunity from punishment other than banishment from the country. Baron Bonelli has prevailed upon the Pope to induce Roma to cause the return and identification of Rossi. Assured of the ultimate security of her husband, Roma writes, urging his return and explaining his safety. When Rossi, acceding to Roma's wishes, touches Italian soil, he is arrested and brought before Bonelli. Roma also is present, and now realizes Bonelli's perfidy. In furious wrath, David denounces Roma for betraying him and. unable to bear the sneers of Bonelli. turns upon him and kills him. With a parting curse upon Roma, David escapes. To shield Rossi, Roma accepts the guilt of the crime, is arrested and imprisoned in the Castle of St. Angelo. David, a shattered soul, with all hope gone, wanders aimlessly about, until Destiny directs him to the bronze doors of the Vatican, where a monk finds him weak and unconscious and brings him into the Pope's palace. The chain of circumstances which drew together the Pope and Rossi gradually reveal them to be father and son. Rossi tells his long, sad story to his father, who in turn tells him of the sacrifice Roma had made for him in accepting his guilt, and that even now she is waiting in the shadow of death for her sentence. Eventually the Pope secures Roma's pardon, and in the final scenes we find Rossi seeking Roma in the Castle of St. Angelo, announcing to her her freedom and his, and preparing to begin life anew together.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

A newspaper report of Curley\'s death frightens the two students and they agree to keep their part in the fight secret. At the end of their college course, Hardin\'s father places him in the shops of the X.Y.&V.C.R.R., of which he is vice-president, but his bad habits still cling and he is discharged by the foreman. His father gives him another chance, promising a home and a comfortable allowance if he will marry and settle down, intimating that Viola Ruskin, the daughter of a personal friend, would be acceptable as a daughter-in-law. John Ballard, on leaving college, studies law and soon becomes one of the rising young men of the day. He meets and falls in love with Viola, and although his love is returned, Mrs. Ruskin compels her daughter, because of financial reasons, to accept the attentions of Hardin. The sudden death of Hardin\'s father influences Mrs. Ruskin to hurry the marriage. A year after a daughter comes to them and the little girl\'s advent changes Hardin into a man of action. Through his money and influence he works his way up to the presidency of the N.Y.&V.C.R.R. John Ballard also becomes a power by his election to the office of District Attorney. There have been numerous fatal wrecks on Hardin\'s road, and yielding to the insistent demands for an investigation. Ballard calls on his old college chum and tries to persuade him to do something for its betterment. Unable to move the railroad president, Ballard threatens legal proceedings and the officers of the road are brought to court. The night before the trial, Hardin remembers the college episode and threatens Ballard with exposure as a murderer unless he stops the prosecution. The District Attorney yields to the threat, and the trial is taken off the calendar. On his return from court, Hardin receives a letter from one of his former gambling friends, who had been a witness of the fight, stating that ""Red"" Curley had been killed in a later fracas. Hardin refuses to do anything about the letter, but his wife, still admiring Ballard, takes the letter and. rushing to the home of the District Attorney, arrives just in time to prevent a tragic scene. Later, Ballard, determined to get proof of the conditions, sends one of his clerks to get a position on the railroad so as to make a personal investigation. Hardin, wishing some proxies, which are in a safe at his country home, phones his wife to get them. The auto in which she is hurrying to her husband, breaks down and she is compelled to flag the express, wiring her husband of the fact. In the meantime Ballard\'s clerk has discovered rotten ties and loose rails on a bridge and wires Hardin of its condition. The telegram from his wife and the one telling of the dangerous bridge reach Hardin about the same time. Realizing the oncoming express on which his wife is riding must cross the weakened bridge, he hurries by automobile and motorboat to try and head off the train. Coming in view of the bridge as the flyer hits the rotten ties, he sees the train crash through into the waters of the river below. The sight was too much for his over-wrought nerves, and he falls over dead. Viola, unconscious is taken from the wreck by John Ballard, who happened to be near the scene of the accident, and while carrying her to a farmhouse comes upon the body. Laying her on the arm of the man who was her husband, he watches her as she succumbs to the shock brought on by the juggernaut of fate.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Her daughter, Alice, on the contrary, is genuinely interested in settlement work and devotes most of her time to it. She is assisted by a poor but promising young physician, Dr. Taylor, who is in love with her and whom she loves. Through their efforts to help a consumptive child, Alice and Dr. Taylor become acquainted with Maggie Schultz and her husband, Heine. Though they live in one of the Burke-Smith tenements they keep their two rooms clean. The wife is sweet and the husband, hard-working and honest. Maggie, who expects a child in the near future, is afraid to confess this fact to Heine, because he holds the theory that it is wrong to bring little ones into the world under the conditions to which they are subject. Over Maggie lives an Irish woman by the name of Bates, who, when her husband was alive, lived in the open, wind-swept spaces of the West and has never forgotten it. She has a good-for-nothing son, Steve, who is a second story man, and who is under the eye of a detective by the name of Rafferty. From Bates, Maggie learns that for the sum of only $100 she could go West with her husband and establish a homestead on the government plan. Alice induces her mother to visit the tenements from which she gets her rent and Mrs. Burke-Smith offers Maggie five dollars a week to work in her house. This five dollars is very much needed, because Heine is out of work through a strike, and Maggie finally accepts the position. She does not definitely decide this, however, until Steve, the second-story man, has offered her the money to go West if she will help him rob the Burke-Smith house. He tries to excuse his plan to Maggie on the ground that Mrs. Burke-Smith is the owner of their wretched tenement, and Maggie, who is frantic because of the secret she dares not reveal, feels that to get the money in this way would only be doing justice to herself and her unborn child. True to her arrangement with Steve, Maggie helps him rob the Burke-Smith house, and receives as her reward a diamond brooch belonging to Alice, which she pawns for $113. Rafferty, the detective, is quickly suspicious and soon forces Maggie into such a position that she confesses to her husband, Heine. When Heine learns what his wife has done, and why she did it, he gives evidence of the finest manhood by standing by her and trying to accept absolutely all the responsibility and blame. Alice, whose kindness for Maggie is unremitting, foils the detective by insisting that she has lent the money to Maggie, and at the same time, getting back her brooch from the place where Maggie has pawned it. There is a final big scene in which Maggie denounces the conditions under which she dwells, and Mrs. Burke-Smith is ultimately touched so that she begins to appreciate how wicked she has been.

Disgusted with the environment Valerie seeks, and smarting from her taunts as to his ill success in authorship, Justin leaves his wife. Valerie is overcome when she reads Justin\'s note. The manager, hastening to the front of the theater, requests the services of a physician. Dr. Pool ministers to Valerie and takes her home. When about to leave her apartment, he accidentally discovers the baby garments that Valerie is preparing. Justin Carew, engaged by Philo Ocumpaugh as his private secretary, accompanies Philo westward where he is called by mining interests. Mrs. Ocumpaugh seeks Dr. Pool, the physician. ""To retain my husband\'s love I must secure a child,"" she tells the physician. Dr. Pool\'s memory reverts to Valerie Carew. He tells Marion Ocumpaugh that for ten thousand dollars he will obtain a child for her. The agreement is reached. In the west, Philo is saved from death by Justin. In the hospital he is overjoyed to receive a message reading: ""It\'s a girl."" In the Meantime, Dr. Pool has worked his hypnotic powers over Valerie Carew, has paid her financial consideration for her newly-born babe, has taken it to Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and neither the real mother nor the pseudo mother are aware of each other\'s identity. In the years that pass, the Ocumpaugh home is made happy for Philo with the presence of the little girl. The child seems to have an abiding love for Justin, and Gwendolyn and the secretary become almost inseparable. It is in reality the call of blood ties. And then a fortune comes to Valerie Carew, the former queen of burlesque, and now a star in the theatrical firmament. She concludes to retire from the stage, and asks Dr. Pool about her little girl. Dr. Pool with a vision of more ill-gotten gains resolves to mulct Valerie just as he did Marion Ocumpaugh. He calls at the Ocumpaugh mansion. He threatens to inform Marion\'s husband of the secret history of ""the millionaire baby"" unless she pays him money. Marion refuses. Dr. Pool then tells Valerie that he will return to her her little girl, for a financial consideration. Another agreement is reached. Valerie Carew buys a home with her newly acquired inheritance, adjacent to the Ocumpaugh residence, being, of course, unconscious that Gwendolyn, whom she meets and whom she learns to love, is her long-lost and long-mourned baby. Marion Ocumpaugh, fearing that Dr. Pool will kidnap Gwendolyn, engages a detective to watch the little girl. The Ocumpaugh\'s give a children\'s party. Dr. Pool is present. He resolves to steal the child that night, but is foiled by seeing the detective on guard. In the meantime, Valerie Carew, through a blunder of Dr. Pool, finds that Gwendolyn is her own. She, too, fearing Dr. Pool\'s machinations, resolves to take the little one. She creeps into the Ocumpaugh garden in her ballroom gown and her dress catches on a rose bush. Following the departure of the guests, it has been found that ""the millionaire baby"" has disappeared. All is excitement. The detective is uncertain whom to suspect. Dr. Pool is non-committal. Valerie Carew is frantic, and Marion Ocumpaugh shows great anxiety. Philo Ocumpaugh, in a hunting camp is wired details and offers $50,000 reward for the recovery of ""the millionaire baby."" The detective, finding a piece of torn dress trimming belonging to Valerie, suspects her. He sees Justin about to leave the Ocumpaugh home and suspects him. His trail leads to Dr. Pool\'s home. He accosts that scheming physician. He finds that Valerie, also suspecting Dr. Pool, has called upon the physician to beseech him to give up her little girl.

Under the circumstances, therefore, seven daughters may be considered a very well-disguised blessing, particularly when the middle one is such a hoyden that she places her sisters' romantic chances in further jeopardy by being expelled from the convent school. That is what the naughty Mici does in the play. She escapes from the school and attends a masked ball, where she meets Count Feri Horkoy. She is caught and dismissed and sent home. This starts all the trouble for the widowed mother of the seven sisters, who on seeing Mici return in a beautiful dress, realizes that she must be placed in the background. Thereupon the rebellious Mici enters into a conspiracy with Count Horkoy to provide husbands for her senior sisters at the earliest possible moment, promising him a kiss with each betrothal. From this moment on the complications grow thick and fast. The girls in each case are duly susceptible to the charms of vigorous and attractive masculinity, but they are apparently indifferent as to the means by which the desirable end is accomplished. As a result we find the oldest sister voluntarily engaging in a most unmaidenly deception to bring about a proposal. She gets the uncle, though she wanted the nephew.

The leaders of this ring are Jim Blake, who is the boss of the party machine, and his son-in-law, Mark Robertson. Standish is being hailed throughout the country as the exponent of morals and virtue, and Blake realizes that the only way to defeat him is to find some blot on his record in the past. He puts a detective to work, who, by bribing Standish's former secretary, finds out that some years ago Standish became involved with a young woman of good family, and that for some reason he did not marry her. Blake realizes that skillfully handled, this story could be made to ruin Standish's career, but without the name of the woman it will look like a campaign lie. So the entire machine bends its energy to discovering the identity of the woman in order to prove the story. To accomplish this, they lay a trap, which they think, will make Standish try to warn the woman by telephone. He is deceived and does telephone the woman to be on her guard, calling the number, Plaza 1001. Wanda Kelly, telephone girl at the Keswick, has been told of the plan by Blake, who believes that she can be bribed to give him the telephone number. After Standish telephones, Robertson, Blake's son-in-law, comes in to 'phone his home in New York, calling the same number that Standish has just called. Wanda, the operator, sees that the woman in the case is really Blake's daughter and Robertson's wife, and besides refusing to give the number, destroys her record sheet. Mrs. Robertson arrives from New York and is driven to desperation when Standish informs her that, though he has tried to protect her, he shall have to give her name to Blake and Robertson if they continue striving to ruin him by this story. The subsequent events leading to the conclusion of the drama and the defeat of the offensive Mullins bill in Congress are stirring in the extreme. Once again the telephone girl interferes in the plot by disconnecting the wires when the ""ring'' politicians, driven to their last ditch, are trying to telephone a newspaper to release the story even without the name of the woman. She keeps her courage after this, even when threatened with arrest and criminal prosecution. It is the woman herself who finally comes to the rescue and refuses to see the little telephone girl made to suffer further on her behalf. This terrible revelation makes Blake and Robertson see what a veritable little heroine she has been and even leads to the happy consummation of a romance between the telephone operator and Jim Blake's son.","['The story relates the attempt of a group of machine politicians at Washington to ruin Matthew Standish, an insurgent who has made himself so strong with the people that he is in a position to defeat the Mullin\'s bill, fostered by a corrupt ring in Washington, in favor of certain railroads.

To accomplish this, they lay a trap, which they think, will make Standish try to warn the woman by telephone. He is deceived and does telephone the woman to be on her guard, calling the number, Plaza 1001. Wanda Kelly, telephone girl at the Keswick, has been told of the plan by Blake, who believes that she can be bribed to give him the telephone number. After Standish telephones, Robertson, Blake\'s son-in-law, comes in to \'phone his home in New York, calling the same number that Standish has just called. Wanda, the operator, sees that the woman in the case is really Blake\'s daughter and Robertson\'s wife, and besides refusing to give the number, destroys her record sheet. Mrs. Robertson arrives from New York and is driven to desperation when Standish informs her that, though he has tried to protect her, he shall have to give her name to Blake and Robertson if they continue striving to ruin him by this story. The subsequent events leading to the conclusion of the drama and the defeat of the offensive Mullins bill in Congress are stirring in the extreme. Once again the telephone girl interferes in the plot by disconnecting the wires when the ""ring\'\' politicians, driven to their last ditch, are trying to telephone a newspaper to release the story even without the name of the woman. She keeps her courage after this, even when threatened with arrest and criminal prosecution. It is the woman herself who finally comes to the rescue and refuses to see the little telephone girl made to suffer further on her behalf. This terrible revelation makes Blake and Robertson see what a veritable little heroine she has been and even leads to the happy consummation of a romance between the telephone operator and Jim Blake\'s son.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

Anitia's dancing so arouses the Sultan that Zarrah jealously locks her in a tower, but she escapes by diving into the sea. Finally captured by guards, Anitia is about to be executed when Prince Omar comes to her rescue. Next, Anitia is thrown into the sea, but she reaches safety in Gnomeland, where she learns that Zarrah has killed the Sultan and instigated a revolt against Omar. Anitia leads the gnomes to Omar's defense, but he accidentally slays her. When he rejects Zarrah's advances, she stabs him to death, whereupon his soul is reunited to the spirit of Anitia.::Pamela Short""]"

Wiley, realizing that he is losing, springs upon Bancroft from behind and gets the combination away from him while his confederate alarms the police and the executive board according to the plan. But Naomi spirits the minister away through a secret passage, rushes to the tabernacle too late to prevent the robbery, and makes the great sacrifice of replacing the stolen money by her own ill-gotten hoard before the bewildered police and board officials arrive at the vault. In the final great moment of spiritual exaltation, Naomi has realized the greatness of Bancroft's love and of his power. Meanwhile Wiley, in an attempt to steal the loot from McCarthy, has wrecked the automobile in which they are fleeing and is killed.::Moving Picture World synopsis""]"

He had not given Marley a thought since the day he buried him, and Scrooge celebrated that day by driving the best of business bargains. On this Christmas Eve Bob Cratchit, his faithful clerk, had been sent home with a gruff word instead of a ""Merry Christmas"" and had been told because he was to have the day off he must come to work extra early on the following morning. Scrooge's nephew had made his accustomed call to ask the old ""grouch"" to dine with him; and Scrooge had been his usual surly self in refusing. Kind-hearted collectors for charity had called, and Scrooge had turned them away with a snarl.

He leaves his Armenian wife and daughter in the care of Abu, a servant. An uprising among the Turks ensues and Mrs. Fitzgerald and the child are taken captive. Returning, Fitzgerald, with Abu, the servant, goes in pursuit. The only thing remaining of his home and wife is a small prayer book. Fitzgerald goes to Mecca to avoid capture, and hides the prayer book in a recess in the wall. Several years pass. Jack Stanton hears Lord Fitzgerald exclaim that it is impossible for any white man to emulate the feat that he did years ago. Stanton claims that if an Englishman could enter Mecca, an American could to it too. A bet is made whereby Stanton is to go to Mecca and, unaided, bring back the prayer book hidden by Fitzgerald. Stanton arrives at Mecca, disguised as a pilgrim. His father was the American Consul at Damascus in Stanton's youth, and his knowledge of Arabic is good. He finds the prayer book, but an Arab named Sadi steals it during the night. Stanton follows Sadi to Damascus. In Damascus Fitzgerald's daughter is living in the care of a presumed stepmother named ""Light of Life,"" who contracts with Amad, a rich diamond merchant, to deliver Faimeh, as she is called, to him as his wife. The marriage takes place in spite of Faimeh's protestations. Amad utters the triple Moslem sentence of divorce, and she is again free. Amad is still desirous of having her, but under the Koranic law, cannot remarry her until she has been married to another man and divorced by him. With El Sabbagh he goes to find a man. They find Stanton, and he is inveigled to do as they ask. Through the lattice work Stanton and Faimeh are married, but Stanton gets a glimpse of her face and refuses to pronounce the triple divorce. A fight ensues and Stanton finds himself with his wife in a walled garden. They make their escape into the desert. There Stanton disguises Faimeh as a boy and himself as a Jewish story teller. Amad and El Sabbagh in pursuit, with Sadi, who has the prayer book in his possession, overtakes them but do not recognize them. A suspicion enters Sadi's mind and he returns and spies on them. Stanton discovers him and a fight ensues in which Sadi is knocked unconscious and Stanton recovers the prayer book. Stanton and Faimeh leave on Sadi's camel and meet Fitzgerald, who is on his way to Damascus. Fitzgerald takes Faimeh with him, but Stanton goes on alone, as the agreement in the wager is that he shall not accept assistance from any Christian. Amad and El Sabbagh find Sadi, who tells them about Stanton and the girl. They start in pursuit, and during a sandstorm Amad is separated from his companions.

He leaves his Armenian wife and daughter in the care of Abu, a servant. An uprising among the Turks ensues and Mrs. Fitzgerald and the child are taken captive. Returning, Fitzgerald, with Abu, the servant, goes in pursuit. The only thing remaining of his home and wife is a small prayer book. Fitzgerald goes to Mecca to avoid capture, and hides the prayer book in a recess in the wall. Several years pass. Jack Stanton hears Lord Fitzgerald exclaim that it is impossible for any white man to emulate the feat that he did years ago. Stanton claims that if an Englishman could enter Mecca, an American could to it too. A bet is made whereby Stanton is to go to Mecca and, unaided, bring back the prayer book hidden by Fitzgerald. Stanton arrives at Mecca, disguised as a pilgrim. His father was the American Consul at Damascus in Stanton\'s youth, and his knowledge of Arabic is good. He finds the prayer book, but an Arab named Sadi steals it during the night. Stanton follows Sadi to Damascus. In Damascus Fitzgerald\'s daughter is living in the care of a presumed stepmother named ""Light of Life,"" who contracts with Amad, a rich diamond merchant, to deliver Faimeh, as she is called, to him as his wife. The marriage takes place in spite of Faimeh\'s protestations. Amad utters the triple Moslem sentence of divorce, and she is again free. Amad is still desirous of having her, but under the Koranic law, cannot remarry her until she has been married to another man and divorced by him. With El Sabbagh he goes to find a man. They find Stanton, and he is inveigled to do as they ask. Through the lattice work Stanton and Faimeh are married, but Stanton gets a glimpse of her face and refuses to pronounce the triple divorce. A fight ensues and Stanton finds himself with his wife in a walled garden. They make their escape into the desert. There Stanton disguises Faimeh as a boy and himself as a Jewish story teller. Amad and El Sabbagh in pursuit, with Sadi, who has the prayer book in his possession, overtakes them but do not recognize them. A suspicion enters Sadi\'s mind and he returns and spies on them. Stanton discovers him and a fight ensues in which Sadi is knocked unconscious and Stanton recovers the prayer book. Stanton and Faimeh leave on Sadi\'s camel and meet Fitzgerald, who is on his way to Damascus. Fitzgerald takes Faimeh with him, but Stanton goes on alone, as the agreement in the wager is that he shall not accept assistance from any Christian. Amad and El Sabbagh find Sadi, who tells them about Stanton and the girl. They start in pursuit, and during a sandstorm Amad is separated from his companions. Stanton has taken refuge behind his camel and Amad stumbles upon him and crawls under the same blanket that is protecting Stanton. The storm abates.

Twenty-nine years pass. Jacques Cordet, now criminal prosecutor for the State, lives with his mother, who is respected as the Widow Cordet. Jacques, the victim of a strange malady, is afflicted with severe headaches. While under their torture he acquires another personality, that of Lazard, ""The Strangler."" As Lazard he is the leader of a band of Apaches. Their rendezvous is The Scarlet Sun Inn. Here Lazard reads of the prosecutor's fight against the Apaches and his efforts to arrest the fiend, ""The Strangler.""

Noting his illness, Despard and Natalia accompany him to his home. There Despard and Christine are startled at their recognition of each other. Jacques goes to his room, and Christine, believing him to be asleep, receives Despard. She tells her old lover of Manuel's assault on her and of the birth of her son, who was christened Jacques Cordet. Meanwhile, Jacques in the personality of Lazard, has gone to Marie. She tells him that it was Manuel who killed her father. As the days pass, Jacques, in love with Natalia, spends his idle hours at the home of Dr. Despard. Marie prepares to avenge her father's death.

One evening she is assaulted by Manuel Le Grange, an escaped murderer, who strangles her father when the latter attempts to save her. Hearing of Villier\'s murder, Despard returns to Christine, but she does not tell him of the attack. The next morning Christine leaves her home. In Paris her son is born and christened Jacques Cordet. Twenty-nine years pass. Jacques Cordet, now criminal prosecutor for the State, lives with his mother, who is respected as the Widow Cordet. Jacques, the victim of a strange malady, is afflicted with severe headaches. While under their torture he acquires another personality, that of Lazard, ""The Strangler."" As Lazard he is the leader of a band of Apaches. Their rendezvous is The Scarlet Sun Inn. Here Lazard reads of the prosecutor\'s fight against the Apaches and his efforts to arrest the fiend, ""The Strangler."" In the personality of Lazard, he does not remember that he is Cordet, whom he hopes to outwit. Marie Sechard objects to her father taking a stranger, Manuel, to board with them. For thirty years Manuel has been lurking in Paris. Later Manuel robs Sechard and kills him. Dragging Marie with him to the Scarlet Inn, he shows her off to his Apache friends. Lazard wins her from Manuel in a fight, in which Lazard\'s wrist is wounded. He falls asleep, and when he awakes, he is unconscious of what his other self passed through in the night. At his office, Jacques, receiving ""The Strangler\'s"" letter, is amazed at the resemblance to his own handwriting. Jacques Despard, now a noted surgeon, entertains his medical colleagues and Jacques Cordet. Despard introduces Cordet to his daughter, Natalia. Cordet is seized with an attack of headache. Noting his illness, Despard and Natalia accompany him to his home. There Despard and Christine are startled at their recognition of each other. Jacques goes to his room, and Christine, believing him to be asleep, receives Despard. She tells her old lover of Manuel\'s assault on her and of the birth of her son, who was christened Jacques Cordet. Meanwhile, Jacques in the personality of Lazard, has gone to Marie. She tells him that it was Manuel who killed her father. As the days pass, Jacques, in love with Natalia, spends his idle hours at the home of Dr. Despard. Marie prepares to avenge her father\'s death. Following Manuel, she sees him enter a residence. It is the home of Dr. Despard. Natalia has given the family jewels to the butler to put into the safe. There is a scream. Natalia and the servants rush in to find the butler dead and the jewels gone. The police pronounce it the work of ""The Strangler.""

Traveling to visit her ancestral estate in France, Angela's luxury ocean liner is sunk by a German U-boat that erroneously believes it to be carrying munitions. Despite the horrific loss of life, she is rescued and ultimately arrives at the family chateau. Because her aunt has died, she inherits the estate, which is commandeered by the Germans as a command post and billet for soldiers. Outraged at the brutal violation of female servants by the barbaric soldiers and the summary execution of a benign old man, she urges Karl, who is among the officers, to put a stop to these war atrocities. When his strict Prussian training trumps his humanity, Angela renounces her neutrality and uses her position in the house to transmit intelligence about the position of the German guns to Jules and the French artillery.::G. Taverney (duke1029@aol.com)"", 'Angela More\'s birthday is the Fourth of July. Count Jules De Destin, an attaché of the French embassy, appears with a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers, but Angela\'s interest is centered in Karl Von Austreim, a German-American. Karl, to please his father, has been educated in Germany, and received his military training in the German army. Jules is about to propose, when the butler announces Karl. He has a box of candy to which is fastened a silk American flag, and the candy is arranged in the same design. Jules realizes he has lost, and after he has retired Karl proposes. He has just been accepted when he is summoned to meet a man who insists upon seeing him. The stranger tells him to report in Germany at once. Karl, unable to explain, asks Angela to wait for him. One day Jules tells her France and Germany are at war, and Angela is horrified, but relieved at her understanding of Karl\'s departure. Angela has an aunt in France in the town of Vangy. The aunt lost her grandson in battle, and writes Angela\'s father asking that she be sent to bring her and her family back to America. Angela writes to Karl, and departs on one of the largest ocean liners. The captain receives word that they are nearing the submarine zone, and orders everything darkened. A German spy leaves two portholes open; the lights are seen by the commander of a submarine, who fires. The boat slowly fills and lists. The ball room is flooded. Angela finally reaches the deck. She gives her life preserver to an older woman and jumps into the water. Coming to the surface she sees an empty raft and pulls herself on board. The next morning she is picked up by a patrol boat. Karl receives the letter, and is making merry in a captured French home when they receive the news of the torpedoing of the Veritania. Karl is horror stricken. The captain commands that they drink to the commander of the submarine. Angela\'s aunt passes away a short time before Angela arrives. The French commander warns that the Germans are approaching, and Angela and her women servants are preparing to depart when the French bring their wounded into the chateau. Angela refuses to leave. Her servants remain with her. Jules arranges with a spy to have a telephone hidden in the chateau. He encounters Angela, who is heartbroken to find he has lost his right arm in battle. He explains she can do a great service if she will permit the spy to serve as butler. Angela consents. She does her best to look after the French wounded, and entertains them. Soon the Germans come. They fire into the dwelling, killing the spy, and batter down the door. Angela protests that the chateau is the residence of American citizens, and shows her flag. Realizing her beauty, several of the officers start for her, and she flees. Angela dashes into a darkened room, Karl follows. Believing Angela has been drowned Karl forgets his manliness and is about to force a kiss, when his elbow hits the electric switch and the sweethearts stand face to face. Angela is horrified, Karl humiliated. He explains he believed her dead; she demands that he protect her women servants. Karl explains that he cannot give orders to his superiors. The commanding officer arrives, makes her remove and dry his muddy boots. Karl secures a pass for Angela, but she sees a line of peasants fall before a firing squad, and tears up her pass, announcing that she will remain. She creeps to the fire place and telephones Jules where the German guns are placed. The French wreck one of the big Howitzers. The second shot hits close to another, and the colonel realizes someone is telephoning the range. Karl finds the wire outlet, and discovers Angela. He urges her to flee. The colonel is knocking at the door, Angela realizes if Karl lets her go, he will be shot, so she pulls down her hair and pretends to struggle. The men believe Karl has captured her and he is congratulated. By a court martial Angela is ordered shot because she refuses to reply to the German third degree. Karl revolts. He flings his sword at the feet of the Colonel and says, ""I am done with you and your Emperor. I was blind to your system. Now, thank God, I see!"" The Colonel orders the woman shot as a spy and the man for treason. Jules has heard Angela scream, orders all guns concentrated on the chateau. Karl and Angela are led before the firing squad. Just as they are about to fire, an avalanche of French shells descends. Karl and Angela are buried in the debris, and chateau is in flames. Finally they crawl forth and Angela, leads Karl through the shells of No Man\'s Land. Unable to make the distance, they conceal themselves in a church. The two collapse at the foot of a cross as a shell wrecks the building. Next morning, Jules sees two figures at the foot of the cross and discovers them to be Angela and the German-American. Angela pleads for Karl and he is put in a concentration camp. Jules sets about to acquaint the government of Angela\'s heroism, and one day she is presented with an official document granting Karl\'s release and transport to America, and the other prisoners are horrified to see a fashionably dressed little American pressing her face against the wires of the detention pen to be kissed by the disheveled German prisoner.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

She is employed in a manicure shop frequented by wealthy men and meets Wilfred Templeton, who invites her to dine with him. He questions her about her dejected air and she tells him of her mother\'s illness. This is Templeton\'s opportunity, and he asks her to make a bargain with him. He will give her all the money she needs and in return she is to live with him in an apartment which he will establish for her. Shirley refuses, but when her mother grows worse she yields and leads her mother and her sister to believe that she has married Templeton and Mrs. Bryson is happy. When James Lowery, the butler in Shirley\'s new home, finds that she is not married to Templeton, he forces his way into her boudoir when she is dressing. With the greatest difficulty Shirley repulses him. She informs Templeton and Lowery is discharged. Everything runs smoothly until Shirley invites her sister to visit her. Emma wants to see this wonderfully generous husband. Shirley is unable to conceal her secret, and Emma wrings a confession from her. The news so preys upon Emma\'s mind that she is unable to keep it a secret from her mother. Stricken at her child\'s dishonor, Mrs. Bryson gives up her battle for life. Shirley leaves Templeton and goes to work as a cabaret entertainer. Lowery again forces his attentions upon her. He openly insults her and a young man at a nearby table comes to her rescue. The man is Harold Templeton, ""Wilfred\'s son, who is the ""black sheep"" of the family, and is living away from home. The acquaintance finally ripens into real affection. The young people are married, but their happiness is clouded by the girl\'s fear that her husband will discover the truth about her past life. The expected happens when Wilfred Templeton forgives his son and comes to call on him and his bride. Shirley and her husband\'s father are brought face to face, and their manner accuses them before either makes a confession. Harold turns against his wife. Later, however, his better nature asserts itself, and he drives his father away. Realizing Shirley\'s mistake was made, not for her own sake, but for her mother\'s, he forgives her and takes her into his arms.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

While Fay goes about with security and fearlessness, which causes the ignorant to regard her with almost religious respect, her inner life is in sharp contrast. She has secret haunts, where she hides, and in thought recreates fairyland. Her favorite retreat is a cavern formed by an old abandoned tunnel which she peoples with knights and princesses, gnomes and fairy guardians. The one thing lacking is the Prince. And one day he comes. The ""Prince"" is a hunchback, ""Crip"" Halloran, the son of the village drunkard, who stumbles into Fay\'s imaginary fairyland, and is at once endowed by her with every heroic attribute. Finally Fay\'s father passes away and Fay becomes a drudge in the hut of ignorant aliens, and the meetings between her and the Prince are few and far between, and ""Crip"" is almost heartbroken. Jack Rockwell, son of a rich mine owner, comes to look after his property. Chance throws him in contact with Fay, and he becomes infatuated with her charm and idealism. He is admitted to the kingdom and gradually dethrones ""Crip,"" to the hunchback\'s bitter distress. In love and pity for Fay\'s misfortune, Rockwell secures a great oculist and an operation opens Fay\'s eyes to the harsh world that her fancy idealized. She sees her two devoted admirers as they really are, and shrinks with horror from the poor misshapen ""Crip."" Broken-hearted, the hunchback seeks the old cavern and with a revolver ends a life that holds nothing but hopeless misery. Rockwell and Fay visit their old haunt, and with years of love and happiness opening before them discover the body of the poor hunchback, who had once for a few happy hours reigned as a Prince in a fairy realm of a girl\'s imagination.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

It was while selling her wares in one of the big restaurants that she is first seen by Caoudal, the famous sculptor, who recognizes her wonderful beauty and persuades her to pose for him. The luxury of his studio awakens in her an unsuspected love for the beautiful things of life. One step leads to another, and it is not long before she becomes the most talked of and sought after model of Paris. She is content to live in this way, reveling in beauty and the admiration of her friends and Caoudal himself, until Dejoie, the poet, moved by her beauty, writes verses to her which make both himself and her still more famous, winning her away from Caoudal. The poet is too old to hold the attention of the young girl, who craves young society and admiration, so when she meets handsome young Flamant, she lightly tells Dejoie that he is ""too old"" and gains the friendship of the younger man. Flamant is an engraver and finds himself hard put to it to gratify the expensive whims of Sapho, but as he is really very fond of the handsome model, he manages to forge a name and obtain money under false pretenses. His ruse is discovered, and as the gendarmes come to lead him away to prison, Sapho receives an invitation to a ball to take place that very evening. At the ball she appears as ""Sapho"" and there meets for the first time the student, Jean Gaussin, with whom she falls in love. It is a case of love at first sight on both sides and the two are very happy, and Sapho is learning to express the better side of her nature when Jean is shocked by accidentally learning of her past life. It is the ""beginning of the end."" Jean finally weds a little country girl, and Sapho, rather than return to her old life, turns Red Cross nurse and consecrates the rest of her life to that noble work.::Moving Picture World synopsis']"

He makes her sign an I.O.U. for herself, promising to pay the debt at any time in the future that he may see fit. ""You\'ll win success,"" the stranger tells her, ""but in the hour of your greatest triumph I shall claim you, and you must return."" She leaves on this condition. Nan\'s voice wins success for her all over the world. As Mlle. Nanon Boldini five years later she is the reigning operatic queen at La Scala, Milan, and then comes to the Metropolitan opera house. New York, to make her American debut in ""Lucia di Lammermoor."" Her success is instantaneous. Two of the most important patrons of the opera house, John Blaisdell and James Van Brunt, business rivals, are united in their admiration of Mlle. Boldini, and obtain an introduction. When Nan discovers the identity of Blaisdell, the man who ruined her father, she says nothing, but quietly plans his downfall. She encourages his attention, even at the risk of displeasing a young stranger with whom she has fallen in love. She refuses an offer of marriage from the man who has won her heart, telling him of her promise made under amazing conditions to a man in Alaska five years ago. That promise, she tells him, must be fulfilled, no matter how great the sacrifice she makes in doing so. Inviting Blaisdell to her apartment to dinner, she has a telephone connection so arranged that James Van Brunt, at his downtown office with the receiver at his ear, hears Blaisdell\'s answers to the carefully prepared questions Nan asks, betraying all his business secrets. As Blaisdell falls across the table in a drunken stupor, after having told everything, Nan\'s triumph is complete. It is at this moment that two fateful cards, the deuces with which the Alaskan won his game, are thrust under the door, and Nan falls fainting. Next day she prepares for her journey to the northland, ready to pay the price of her five years\' freedom. The man she loves insists on accompanying her. Going to her little cabin, she finds it sumptuously furnished. As she turns to her lover in surprise, he places on the table a crumpled ""I.O.U."" then tears it in two, giving her the pieces. As the realization slowly dawns on Nan that the man she has learned to love is the bearded stranger of so long ago, she fits the two pieces of the ""I.O.U."" together again, and presenting them to him, creeps into the arms of her stranger-lover.::Moving Picture World synopsis', ""A young woman swears revenge on the man who left her father destitute in the Alaska gold fields.

She has dreamed of romantic love, intoxicating adventure, and tumultuous passions only to find none of these things in retirement with a good husband. She decided that her existence has been wrecked and ruined, and gets it into her foolish head that the only remedy is a divorce. There is a lover handy, her husband's cousin Adhemar, French in his ambition to have an ""affair"" with some charming married woman, and equally French in his thrift; he is a poor young man in no situation to marry any such extravagant young lady. The clear-headed husband enters into a little conspiracy with some friends to let his bored young wife have her own way, ostensibly yielding to her wishes, and he even makes things as easy and comfortable as possible for the unsuspecting lover, inviting him to the house, and announcing that he has even provided for his wife's future by settling a large sum of money upon her. She sees that this settlement has weight with the lover, and begins to falter, but she goes on determinedly with what gradually loses all the charm of forbidden fruit. Her relations with Adhemar become more and more commonplace at a time when she begins to realize her husband's magnanimity. He has denied her nothing, and he gives Adhemar full permission to marry her as soon as the divorce is granted. Meanwhile she begins to be distressed by the fact that her husband seems to be enjoying himself, staying out late at night, and suspects that he has an ""affair"" with some woman ""not worthy"" of him. She revolts when he announces he has a dinner engagement, urges him to break it and have a little celebration with her and Adhemar, finally deciding to leave Adhemar out altogether.

Adhemar learns of the infidelity of his wife-to-be, and goes in search of her in a rainstorm.

Despite his disabilities, the embittered Blizzard rises in the underworld by sheer ruthlessness and force of will. Although his empire includes prostitution, gambling, drug-dealing, human trafficking, and murder, he is also planning something much larger. Secret Service Head Lichtenstein assigns Rose, his most beautiful and resourceful agent, to infiltrate Blixzzard\'s gang and discover his plans. She soon becomes his current mistress but becomes ambivalent about informing Lichtenstein of the ganglord\'s activities as she finds herself falling in love with him. Blizzard finally finds a way to revenge himself on Ferris by insinuating himself with Ferris\' beautiful sculptress daughter as a model and ultimately hoping to seduce her. Rose ultimately discovers that Blizzard\'s master plan encompasses an uprising by the city\'s large Asian and Eastern European immigrant population, an insurrection that will loot and sack the city, but will she betray the man she now calls ""Master?""::duke1029@aol.com']"

In Argentina, Frenchman Marcelo Desnoyers and German Karl von Hartrott are the two sons-in-law of well-off Argentine farm owner Don Julio Madariaga, Desnoyers the favored one. Within this family collective, there is a special bond between Madariaga and one of his grandsons, Julio Desnoyers, who, like his maternal grandfather in his day, is a ladies man. Out of circumstance, the Desnoyers and the von Hartrotts move to their respective fatherlands of France and Germany following Madariaga\'s death. In France, Julio leads a rather carefree and irresponsible life, making a living as an artist and a tango instructor, the meager income from which is supplemented by money from his mother on the sly for him to be able to maintain the lavish life to which he is accustomed. That lavish life, through his ""work"", includes casual relationships with multiple women. Julio\'s view of life changes when he and Marguerite Laurier fall in love, Julio who has no interest in any other woman anymore. The issue is that Marguerite is already married, she who is not nor has ever been in love with her older husband in an arranged marriage, Etienne Laurier. Beyond the issue of Marguerite being a married woman, the murder of Archduke Ferdinand leading to the onset of the Great War affects what happens not only between Julio and Marguerite but also within this entire collective. The war complicates the family unit as the Desnoyers and the von Hartrotts are on opposing sides of the conflict, patriotism in this case which may trump blood seeing as to the nature of their time together in Argentina. And while Marcelo sees himself as being patriotic to the cause of France, Julio may not feel the same for his adopted home, he who may focus more on his own personal situation of wanting to be with Marguerite.::Huggo']"
